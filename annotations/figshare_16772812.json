Four of these correspond to figures in the results section of the manuscript, and each one contains a separate README file detailing its contents. They include Gromacs and Lammps scripts with example simulation set-ups to run simulations corresponding to figures 2 [potentials of mean force of all-atom models], 4 [radius of gyration simulations of coarse-grained models], 5 [direct-coexistence simulations used to determine the phase diagrams] and 6 [multiphase equilibria] of the manuscript. The directories contain input scripts and corresponding parameter and simulation configuration files, as well as example simulation output to benchmark against.The final directory, 'all-model-parameters', contains Lammps parameter files not only for the Mpipi potential, but also for all the other models we have benchmarked in the paper. These parameter files can be used instead of the Mpipi parameters in the simulations provided in the other directories.", {"entities": [[372, 380, "MOL"], [485, 491, "SOFT"], [762, 769, "SOFT"], [774, 780, "SOFT"], [1310, 1316, "SOFT"], [1350, 1355, "FFM"], [1484, 1489, "FFM"]]}]]}
