 POPC MOLECULE Ulmschneider OPLS Verlet Group MD simulation trajectory and related files for fully hydrated POPC MOLECULE bilayer run with Verlet and Group schemes. The Ulmschneider force field for POPC MOLECULE was used with Gromacs 5.0.3 SOFTWARE [1,2]. Conditions: T=298.15 TEMPERATURE , 128 POPC MOLECULE molecules, 5120 tip3p waters. MOLECULE 200ns SIMULATION TIME trajectory (preceded by 5ns NPT equillibration). Starting structure was obtained from CHARMM-GUI SOFTWARE [3]. This data is ran for the nmrlipids.blospot.fi project.
