Simulations of POPC lipid bilayer in water solution with various molar fractions of cationic surfactant dihexadecylammonium using ECC-POPC force field
Classical molecular dynamics simulations of a POPC lipid bilayer in water solution with various molar fractions of cationic surfactant dihexadecylammonium using ECC-POPC force field parameters, SPC/E water model and ECC-ions. Simulation at pure water is in a separate Zenodo deposit https://removed file names report molar fraction of cations (i.e. not bulk concentrations) simulations performed with Gromacs 5.1.4 (*.xtc files) and openMM 7 (*.dcd files) simulation length 200 ns temperature 313 K (otherwise noted)
