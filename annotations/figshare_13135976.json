The simulation was generated using GROMACS v.4.6.5 with the AMBER99SB-ILDN forcefield (altered following doi:10.1002/jcc.10262, see References), TIP3P water and 0.15 M salt. The leap-frog integrator with 2 fs timestep was used. A v-rescale thermostat was used at 310 K, with two energy groups (protein + GTP + MG and water + salt) and a time constant of 0.1 ps. PME was used with a tolerance of 1e-5 for the coulomb interactions and a cutoff was used for the VdW interactions, both with a cutoff of 1.1 nm. A Parrinello-rahman barostat was applied with a reference pressure of 1 bar and a time constant of 1 ps. For more information take a look at md.mdp. Coordinates were saved every 1 nanosecond and waters were stripped, resulting in a trajectory of 101 snapshots. The initial model was made using the G-domain of GppNHp bound H-Ras (PDB ID: 4EFL). The protein was converted using MODELLER v9.16 (doi:10.1002/cpbi.3 , see References) and GppNHp was converted to GTP by hand.", {"entities": [[68, 75, "MOL"], [210, 217, "MOL"], [289, 304, "SOFT"], [314, 328, "FFM"], [399, 404, "FFM"], [405, 410, "MOL"], [517, 522, "TEMP"], [558, 561, "MOL"], [564, 566, "MOL"], [571, 576, "MOL"], [956, 962, "MOL"], [1071, 1077, "MOL"], [1084, 1089, "MOL"], [1138, 1152, "SOFT"], [1195, 1201, "MOL"], [1219, 1222, "MOL"]]}]]}
