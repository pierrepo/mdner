Data for "Emergence of Coupled Rotor Dynamics in Metal Organic Frameworks via Tuned Steric Interactions"
Raw data for "Emergence of Coupled Rotor Dynamics in Metal Organic Frameworks via Tuned Steric Interactions" by Adrian Gonzalez-Nelson, Srinidhi Mula, Mantas S ime nas, Sergejus Balc iu nas, Adam R. Altenhof, Cameron S. Vojvodin, Stefano Canossa, Ju ras Banys, Robert W. Schurko, Franc ois-Xavier Coudert, and Monique A. van der VeenDataset includes NMR, BDS, DFT and AIMD data used for analysis and plotting. Representative input files for DFT and Molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations are also included. Python code for calculating the rotational angle between the benzene ring and reference plane from the CP2K MD trajectories ( *.xyz) is deposited on Github at https://github.com/srinidhimula/supplementary-data
