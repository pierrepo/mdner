The first from the set of 6 simulations. The goal was to study the effect of scaling the CHARMM FF on the ion binding. Done for the NMRlipids project, see https://removed for more information. A POPC bilayer consisting of 200 lipids (100 per leaflet) is simulated. The Charmm36 model is employed for lipids, the Charmm compatible variant of the tip3p model for water. The Charmm36 force field parameters were obtained from https://removed The files are in GROMACS format. Trajectory (.xtc) is 380 ns long with data saved every 100 ps. the initial structure (.gro), topology (.top), index file (.ndx), simulation paremeter file (.mdp), binary run input file for GROMACS v. 5.1 > (.tpr) and the energy output file (.edr) are provided.
