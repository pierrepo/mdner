Among the various cell membrane components, cholesterol (CHL) is known to regulate protein function and its concentration can reach up to 50 mol %. However, studies comprising cholesterol are challenging due to its hydrophobic nature, hence, nanodiscs with only a low cholesterol concentration have been studied. To overcome the problem, cholesterol analogs with high solubility in polar solutions are often used, and one of them is cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS). Nevertheless, in molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, this is not an obstacle. In this study, we performed MD simulations of nanodiscs containing neutral phosphatidylcholine (POPC) lipids, negatively charged phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) lipids, CHL, or negatively charged cholesterol analog, CHS. Our simulations show that CHS increases the order of lipids in nanodiscs; the effect is, however, weaker than CHL and even smaller in nanodiscs. Furthermore, CHS gathered around scaffold proteins while cholesterol was uniformly distributed in the nanodiscs. Thus, nanodiscs with CHS are heterogeneous and not equivalent to nanodiscs with CHL. Finally, we also observed the increased concentration of POPG near the scaffold proteins, driven by electrostatic interactions. The MD results are experimentally validated using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. These results show that nanodiscs are, in fact, complex structures not easily comparable with planar lipid bilayers.", {"entities": [[0, 25, "MOL"], [56, 67, "MOL"], [309, 320, "MOL"], [322, 325, "MOL"], [441, 452, "MOL"], [533, 544, "MOL"], [603, 614, "MOL"], [698, 723, "MOL"], [725, 728, "MOL"], [884, 903, "MOL"], [905, 909, "MOL"], [938, 958, "MOL"], [960, 964, "MOL"], [974, 977, "MOL"], [1001, 1012, "MOL"], [1021, 1024, "MOL"], [1052, 1055, "MOL"], [1136, 1139, "MOL"], [1184, 1187, "MOL"], [1228, 1239, "MOL"], [1305, 1308, "MOL"], [1364, 1367, "MOL"], [1426, 1430, "MOL"], [1694, 1699, "MOL"]]}]]}
