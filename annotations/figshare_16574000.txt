All-atom molecular dynamics simulation of peptides
The initial structure was built using the LEaP module of AmberTools21, and we will run a total of 4000 minimization steps before starting to run molecular dynamics; 2000 is the steepest decline, followed by the conjugate gradient of 2000. That should be enough to clean up our structures. Then heat and equilibrate in three 250 ps stages: from heat 100 K to production temperature 300K, heavy atom position limiting, force constant decreasing from 10.0 to 1.0, then decreasing to 0.1 kcal/mol/A 2. The step size was set to 0.002 and the unconstrained production simulation was performed in an implicit generalized Bonn solvent (igb 8) in the canonical ensemble (NVT). The temperature was controlled by a Langevin thermostat (ntt 3) and molecular dynamics was performed for 200ns at a collision frequency of   0.01 ps-1 (For implicit solvent, setting collision frequency to 0.01ps 1 can lead to significant, up to 100-fold in some cases, speedup of conformational sampling). Finally, the cpptraj module of AmberTools21 was used for combined clustering, RMSD, and other molecular dynamics trajectory analysis.
