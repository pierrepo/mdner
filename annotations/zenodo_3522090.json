This dataset consists of the molecular dynamics simulations trajectory and topology of Cruzain, Cathepsin K and Cathepsin L enzymes in noncovalent and covalent complexes with selective ligand against Cruzain (ICL* and CCL) and Cathepsin K (IKR and CKR). We ran five replicate 100ns simulations on each complex, with randomized initial velocities.
