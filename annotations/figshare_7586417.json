Although prophylactic HPV vaccines have been approved; it is still necessary a drug-based treatment against the infection and its oncogenic effects. The E6 oncoprotein is one of the most studied therapeutic targets of HPV, it has been identified as a key factor in cell immortalization and tumor progression in HPV-positive cells. E6 can promote the degradation of p53, a tumor suppressor protein, through the interaction with the cellular ubiquitin ligase E6AP. Therefore, preventing the formation of the E6-E6AP complex is one of the main strategies to inhibit the viability and proliferation of infected cells. Herein, we propose an in silico pipeline to identify small-molecule inhibitors of the E6-E6AP interaction. Virtual screening was carried out by predicting the ADME properties of the molecules and performing ensemble-based docking simulations to E6 protein followed by binding free energy estimation through MM/PB (GB)SA methods. Finally, the top-three compounds were selected, and their stability in the E6 docked complex and their effect in the inhibition of the E6-E6AP interaction was corroborated by molecular dynamics simulation. Therefore, this pipeline and the identified molecules represent a new starting point in the development of anti-HPV drugs.This fileset contains raw data from molecular dynamics simulations of HPV-16 E6 protein, including initial files and backbone trajectories. Also includes the initial compound library, ADME properties predictions, molecular docking results and hit compounds in mol2 format.", {"entities": [[27, 29, "MOL"], [30, 37, "MOL"], [438, 440, "MOL"], [441, 452, "MOL"], [616, 618, "MOL"], [650, 653, "MOL"], [674, 681, "MOL"], [725, 746, "MOL"], [791, 793, "MOL"], [794, 798, "MOL"], [985, 987, "MOL"], [988, 992, "MOL"], [1144, 1146, "MOL"], [1147, 1154, "MOL"], [1303, 1305, "MOL"], [1363, 1365, "MOL"], [1366, 1370, "MOL"], [1633, 1635, "MOL"], [1636, 1643, "MOL"]]}]]}
