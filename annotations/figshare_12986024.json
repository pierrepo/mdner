Its activation involves an interaction between the C1 domain and diacylglycerol (DAG) at intracellular membrane surfaces; DAG mimetics hold promise as new drugs. We previously developed the isophthalate derivative HMI-1a3, an effective but highly lipophilic (clogP   6.46) DAG mimetic. Although a less lipophilic pyrimidine analog, PYR-1gP (clogP   3.30), gave positive results in computational docking, it unexpectedly presented greatly diminished binding to PKC in vitro. Through more rigorous computational molecular modeling, we reveal that, unlike HMI-1a3, PYR-1gP forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond, which both obstructs binding and reorients PYR-1gP in the membrane in a fashion that prevents it from correctly accessing the PKC C1 domain. Our results highlight the great value of molecular dynamics simulations as a key component for the drug design process of ligands targeting weakly membrane-associated proteins, where simulation in the relevant membrane environment is crucial for obtaining biologically applicable results.", {"entities": [[105, 121, "MOL"], [144, 160, "MOL"], [162, 165, "MOL"], [276, 290, "MOL"], [292, 295, "MOL"], [333, 336, "MOL"], [401, 413, "MOL"], [425, 432, "MOL"], [484, 487, "MOL"], [524, 534, "MOL"], [543, 550, "MOL"], [671, 674, "MOL"], [764, 771, "MOL"], [773, 780, "MOL"], [863, 870, "MOL"], [946, 949, "MOL"]]}]]}
