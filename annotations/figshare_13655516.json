Germinant receptors (GRs) in spore s inner membrane respond to ligands such as L-alanine, and trigger spore germination. In B. subtilis spores, GerA is the major GR, and has three subunits, GerAA, GerAB, and GerAC. L-Alanine activation of GerA requires all three subunits, but which binds L-alanine is unknown. To date, how GRs trigger germination is unknown, in particular due to lack of detailed structural information about B subunits. Using homology modelling with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we present structural predictions for the integral membrane protein GerAB. These predictions indicate that GerAB is an alpha-helical transmembrane protein containing a water channel. The MD simulations with free L-alanine show that alanine binds transiently to specific sites on GerAB. These results provide a starting point for unraveling the mechanism of L-alanine mediated signaling by GerAB, which may facilitate early events in spore germination.", {"entities": [[0, 5, "MOL"], [70, 89, "MOL"], [91, 94, "MOL"], [149, 158, "MOL"], [214, 218, "MOL"], [232, 234, "MOL"], [260, 265, "MOL"], [267, 272, "MOL"], [278, 283, "MOL"], [285, 294, "MOL"], [309, 313, "MOL"], [359, 368, "MOL"], [394, 397, "MOL"], [644, 649, "MOL"], [683, 688, "MOL"], [788, 797, "MOL"], [855, 860, "MOL"], [933, 942, "MOL"], [965, 970, "MOL"]]}]]}
