In addition, E353 and E422 are protonated as predicted by PROPKA. BH4 molecule parametrization was performed by using GAFF, Antechamber and amb2chm par.py program of Amber2018. 5,000-step minimization and 1 ns equilibration were performed by fixing the protein to relax the system. Then, another 5,000-step minimization and 1 ns equilibration were performed without any constraints, except the SHAKE algorithm on water molecules, to relax the protein and system. The production simulations were performed along 100 ns trajectory at 310 K collected under NpT ensemble.
