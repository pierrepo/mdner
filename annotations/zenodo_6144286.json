The active mSMO conformation was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6O3C). The hSMO structure was determined using X-ray crystallography as outlined within this study. File description for each system: - md fit firstframe.pdb : Initial frame used for atomistic simulations (replicate 1, each replicate equilibrated independently). - md fit X.xtc : Gromacs trajectory file for each replicate (X replicate number).
