SOD1 WT I35A REST2.zip:\u00a0The zip archive\u00a0includes REST2\u00a0trajectories for the two SOD1 constructs and the two force fields investigated\u00a0in the paper. The trajectories are saved in the GROMACS XTC file format, separately for each temperature (i=0,...,23). Owing to the considerable trajectory sizes, only protein coordinates are reported, and the output frequency is reduced to\u00a0100 ps. The initial\u00a0geometry (in the Gromos87 GRO format)\u00a0after a short relaxation\u00a0is provided for each REST2 simulation (conf prot.gro).\u00a0Furthermore, for each REST2 simulation, an xarray (https://removed dataset, saved in the netCDF file format,\u00a0is included and contains the following observables:\u00a0fraction\u00a0of native contacts relative to the crystal structure, secondary-structure content (i.e., the fraction of protein residues found in an alpha-helix, beta-sheet, beta-bridge, or a turn), as well as the number of residues with the beta-sheet secondary structure per each beta-strand and beta-sheet of the SOD1 barrel.", {"entities": [[60, 82, "MOLECULE"], [180, 215, "MOLECULE"], [249, 253, "MOLECULE"], [329, 333, "MOLECULE"], [431, 438, "SOFTWARE"], [551, 558, "MOLECULE"], [661, 669, "FF & MODEL"], [1037, 1044, "MOLECULE"], [1233, 1237, "MOLECULE"]]}]]}
