POPC MOLECULE Ulmschneider OPLS NaCl MOLECULE 1Mol MD simulation trajectory and related files for fully hydrated POPC MOLECULE bilayer with 1M NaCl. MOLECULE The Ulmschneider force field for POPC MOLECULE was used with Gromacs 5.0.3 SOFTWARE [1,2]. Ions MOLECULE were described by OPLS-AA force field ( Gromacs 5.0.3 SOFTWARE ). Conditions: T=298.15 TEMPERATURE , 128 POPC MOLECULE molecules, 5120 tip3p waters MOLECULE , 77 Na MOLECULE , 77 Cl. MOLECULE 200ns SIMULATION TIME trajectory (preceded by 5ns NPT equillibration). This data is ran for the nmrlipids.blospot.fi project. More details from nmrlipids.blospot.fi and https://removed [1] J.P. Ulmschneider & M.B.
