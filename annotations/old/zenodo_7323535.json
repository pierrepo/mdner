Temperature = 300 K. Force Field: AMBER99SB-ILDN. There are 30+ back and forth transitions between the C 7eq and the C 7ax state. Simulations were performed using GROMACS 2021.4. The .tpr file is provided for reproduction. Details of the simulation parameters are accessible from the md.log file. The phi and psi torsion angles and the internal energy is printed in the COLVAR file at 2 ps interval.\u00a0\u00a0 Alanine dipeptide is often used as a model system to test new simulation methods. We hope that sharing our long unbiased trajectory will help other research groups to compare the accuracy of the results obtained from new methods.\u00a0 This trajectory was generated as a part of our recent publication below.
