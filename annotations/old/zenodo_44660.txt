MD simulation trajectory and related files for POPC MOLECULE bilayer with 30 mol% of protonated pazePC MOLECULE (Berger, Gromacs SOFTWARE 4.5.) Simulation trajectory and related files for POPC MOLECULE bilayer with 30mol% of pazePC MOLECULE in deprotonated form used in " Acyl MOLECULE chain disorder and azelaoyl MOLECULE orientation in lipid MOLECULE membranes containing oxidised lipids MOLECULE " by T. M. Ferreira, et al. https://removed The simulation with deprotonated pazePC MOLECULE from the same publication available at https://removed 90 POPC MOLECULE , 38 pazePC MOLECULE , 7250 water MOLECULE and 38 potassium MOLECULE molecules. Simulation time 167ns. SIMULATION TIME   Force field for POPC MOLECULE is based on Berger model and force field for pazePC MOLECULE is modified from H. Khandelia and O. G.
