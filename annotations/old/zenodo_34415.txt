POPC AMBER LIPID14 CaCl2 035Mol MD simulation trajectory and related files for fully hydrated POPC bilayer with 0.35M CaCl2. The LIPID14 force field was used with Gromacs 5.0.3. Ions were described by AMBER99SB-ILDN force field. Conditions: T=298.15, 128 POPC molecules, 6400 tip3p waters (lipid/water 1:50), 35 Ca, 70 Cl. 200ns trajectory  (preceded by 5ns NPT equillibration) (2 files of 100ns). THE TRAJECTORY "035M CaCl2 POPC AMB 100 200ns.xtc" IS CORRUPTED. FOR THE UNCORRUPTED FILE PLEASE FOLLOW THE LINK: https://removed This data is ran for the nmrlipids.blospot.fi project.
