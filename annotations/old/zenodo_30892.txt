 POPC MOLECULE Ulmschneider OPLS NaCl MOLECULE 015Mol MD simulation trajectory and related files for fully hydrated POPC MOLECULE bilayer with 0.15M NaCl. MOLECULE The Ulmschneider force field for POPC MOLECULE was used with Gromacs 5.0.3 SOFTWARE [1,2]. Ions MOLECULE were described by OPLS-AA force field ( Gromacs 5.0.3 SOFTWARE ). Conditions: T=298.15 TEMPERATURE , 128 POPC MOLECULE molecules, 5120 tip3p waters MOLECULE , 12 Na MOLECULE , 12 Cl. MOLECULE 200ns SIMULATION TIME trajectory (preceded by 5ns SIMULATION TIME NPT equillibration). This data is ran for the nmrlipids.blospot.fi project.
