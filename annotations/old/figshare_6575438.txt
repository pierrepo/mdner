Models and trajectories of GLUTAMINE SYNTHETASE MOLECULE with palmitoyl-coenzyme A MOLECULE These are the models and molecular dynamics trajectories obtained for the paper Role of glutamine synthetase MOLECULE in angiogenesis beyond glutamine MOLECULE synthesis [G. Eelen et al. Nature 2018 vol. 561 (7721) pp. 63-69].The PDB files (human.pdb and bacterial.pdb) contain representative structures extracted from the molecular dynamics simulations of the S. Typhimurium (bacterial.pdb) and Human Glutamine Synthetase MOLECULE (human.pdb). For the latter, models of the two most relevant binding modes of Palmitoyl-CoA MOLECULE are included in the file.The trajectories included are the FINAL 450 ns SIMULATION TIME of 2 fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of Glutamine Synthetase MOLECULE (GS) performed with GROMACS SOFTWARE and the Amber ff14SB force field. The Human GS.x is the trajectory of human GS (reference PDB 2OJW) with Palmitoyl-CoA. MOLECULE In this trajecory the palmitate tail points upwards (which was the most interesting orientation found). "Bacterial GS" is the bacterial GS trajectory (reference starting PDB 1FPY) with Palmitoyl-CoA MOLECULE - palmitate MOLECULE tail points downwards. The trajectories are in GROMACS SOFTWARE trr format and have been saved every 200ps. Water MOLECULE molecules and the initial 50 ns SIMULATION TIME (relaxation) are not included in the files.
