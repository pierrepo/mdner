However, clinical trials of several CETP inhibitors with various potencies have been marginally successful at best, raising doubts on the target drugability of CETP. The in-depth understanding of the glycosylated CETP structure could be beneficial to more definitive descriptions of the CETP function and the underlying mechanism. In this work, large-scale molecular dynamics simulations were performed to thoroughly explore the mechanism of glycans modulating CETP. Here, the extensive simulation results intensely suggest that glycan88 tends to assist CETP in forming a continuous tunnel throughout interacting with the upper-right region of the N-barrel, while it also could prevent the formation of a continuous tunnel by swinging toward the right-rear of the N-barrel. Furthermore, glycan240 formed stable H-bonds with Helix-B and might further stabilize the central cavity of CETP. Furthermore, the nonspecific involvement of the hydroxyl groups from the various glycans with protein core interactions and the similar influence of different glycans trapped at similar regions on the protein structure suggest that physiological glycan may lead to a similar effect. This study would provide valuable insights into devising novel methods for CVD treatment targeting CETP and functional studies about glycosylation for other systems.", {"entities": []}]]}
