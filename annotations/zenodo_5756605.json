N-glycsoylated and aglycosylated configurations were compared in triplicate.\u00a0 This data set contains atomic structure of the TCR and pMHC (.gro files), atomic\u00a0interactions between the TCR and pMHC (hmap & cmap .csv files), and rendered trajecories of the pulling simulations (.mp4).", {"entities": [[0, 15, "MOLECULE"], [27, 42, "MOLECULE"], [152, 155, "MOLECULE"], [243, 258, "MOLECULE"], [260, 263, "MOLECULE"], [272, 320, "MOLECULE"], [322, 327, "MOLECULE"], [503, 506, "MOLECULE"], [511, 515, "MOLECULE"], [562, 565, "MOLECULE"], [570, 574, "MOLECULE"]]}]]}
