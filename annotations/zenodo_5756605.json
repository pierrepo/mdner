The force-dependent bond lifetime and bond strength of the DMF5 T Cell Receptor (TCR) to the MART1 peptide-Major Histocompatibility Complexes (pMHCs) were simulated using Steered Molecular Dynamics. N-glycsoylated and aglycosylated configurations were compared in triplicate. This data set contains atomic structure of the TCR and pMHC (.gro files), atomic interactions between the TCR and pMHC (hmap & cmap .csv files), and rendered trajecories of the pulling simulations (.mp4).", {"entities": [[27, 42, "MOL"], [152, 155, "MOL"], [238, 242, "MOL"], [243, 258, "MOL"], [260, 263, "MOL"], [272, 320, "MOL"], [322, 327, "MOL"], [502, 505, "MOL"], [510, 514, "MOL"], [561, 564, "MOL"], [569, 573, "MOL"]]}]]}
