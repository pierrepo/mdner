The second from the set of 6 simulations. The goal was to study the effect of scaling the CHARMM FF on the ion binding. Done for the NMRlipids project, see https://removed for more information. A POPC bilayer consisting of 200 lipids (100 per leaflet) is simulated in the presence of 450 mM CaCl 2. The Charmm36 model is employed for lipids, the Charmm compatible variant of the tip3p model for water, and the default Charmm ion parameters (type CAL) for CaCl 2. The new extra nonbonded parameters were used for trating the calcium bonding (NB-Fix) The Charmm36 force field parameters were obtained from https://removed The files are in GROMACS format.
