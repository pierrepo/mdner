Each simulation consisted of cations, anions, and solvent, all of which are modelled as beads of diameter (the Lennard-Jones unit of distance) and unit mass. If the size of each bead is mapped to the size of a water molecule (2.75 A ), the concentration range of 0.0005 3 to 0.05 3 approximately corresponds to 0.04 M to 4 M in real units. For example, the system with concentration 0.01 3 and Bjerrum length 4.0 has the following relevant file names: \"conc0.01 lb4.0.dcd\" contains the MD trajectory, and \"initial config conc0.01.gsd\" contains the initial configuration. The jupyter notebook \"sample data analysis.ipynb\" illustrates how to load these trajectories as well as the computed molar conductivities for each system. \"transport coefficients.zip\" contains the computed Onsager transport coefficients for each of the simulated systems.
