Simulations are performed with GROMACS 4.5.6, and all simulation outputs and inputs are provided. The simulation parameter file (mdp) is common for all systems. Simulation details and explanation of the data are provided in the related publication \"Protein Crowding in Lipid Bilayers Gives Rise to Non-Gaussian Anomalous Lateral Diffusion of Phospholipids and Proteins\" by Jae-Hyung Jeon et al. at https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.6.021006", {"entities": []}]]}
