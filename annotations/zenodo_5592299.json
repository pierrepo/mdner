S. # Content The folder \"glycamstructures\" contains the output from GLYCAM carbohydrate builder with force-field parameters, coordinates and topology of a single chain of cellulose composed of 4 cellobiose units. The folder \"intermol\" contains the output from the software Intermol were the content of \"glycamstructures\" is translated into the lingo of LAMMPS. The folder \"packmol\" contains input files for the software Packmol, which was used for creating coordinate-files for solvated systems of cellulose with water and cellulose with the solvent mixture. (The bash-script clean.sh fixes the formatting of the .xyz-files such that LAMMPS can read it.) The folder \"36bundle\" contains input files for creating the initial configuration of the bundle with 36 chains in a maze configuration, namely 36bundle.sh reads 1chain.xyz to make the coordinate file 36bundle.xyz. Further, nvt00.in is the initial LAMMPS script for slowly starting up this system with the NVT-ensemble, which reads system information from the LAMMPS-datafile chain.36bundle, cellulose parameters from the LAMMPS-datafile data.cellulose nohybrid and coordinates from 36bundle.xyz. nvt01.in and nvt02.in continues sequentially, resulting in the configuration stored in the LAMMPS data-file chain.nvt02. The folder \"36bundle mix\" continues from 36bundle by first adding the solvent mixture with coordinates from Packmol in the file 36bm.xyz and slowly starting up in the NVT-ensemble with nvt00.in, with force-field parameters in data.cellulose.in, data.water spce.in, data.naoh.in and data.urea.in, with charges and connectivity of the solvent molecules in the files water spce.txt, naoh.txt and urea.txt. The LAMMPS script npt00.in continues with the NPT-ensemble, which is continued with npt01.in etc., resulting in the configuration stored in the LAMMPS data-file chain.npt06. These systems can be continued with length- or force-controlled oscillatory stretching/compression with osc length.in and osc force.in respectively, which was used to make the configurations stored in the LAMMPS data-files chain.osc length4 and chain.osc force4. Similarly, the folder \"36bundle water\" continues from 36bundle by first adding the water with coordinates from Packmol in the file 36bw.xyz and slowly starting up in the NVT-ensemble with nvt00.in, with force-field parameters in data.cellulose.in and data.water spce.in, with charges and connectivity of the water molecules in the file water spce.txt. Again, these systems can be continued with length- or force-controlled oscillatory stretching/compression with osc length.in and osc force.in respectively, which was used to make the configurations stored in the LAMMPS data-files chain.osc length4 and chain.osc force4.", {"entities": [[69, 78, "MOL"], [176, 185, "MOL"], [237, 246, "MOL"], [426, 432, "SOFT"], [433, 445, "MOL"], [529, 538, "MOL"], [553, 563, "MOL"], [631, 639, "SOFT"], [711, 717, "SOFT"], [778, 785, "SOFT"], [856, 865, "MOL"], [881, 890, "MOL"], [992, 998, "SOFT"], [1260, 1266, "SOFT"], [1372, 1378, "SOFT"], [1404, 1413, "MOL"], [1434, 1440, "SOFT"], [1600, 1606, "SOFT"], [1738, 1745, "SOFT"], [2037, 2043, "SOFT"], [2177, 2183, "SOFT"], [2412, 2418, "SOFT"], [2581, 2588, "SOFT"], [3034, 3040, "SOFT"]]}]]}
