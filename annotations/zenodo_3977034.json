We have characterized the molecular mechanism by which these divalent cations interact with phosphoinositides. Calcium desolvates more readily, consistent with single-molecule calculations, and forms a network of ionic-like bonds that serve as a \"molecular glue'' that allows a single ion to coordinate with up to three phosphatidylinositol- (4,5)-bisphosphate lipids. The phosphatidylinositol- (3,5)-bisphosphate isomer shows no such effect and neither does PI (4,5)P2 in the presence of Mg. The resulting network of Ca-mediated lipid-lipid bonds grows to span the entire simulation space and therefore has implications for the lateral distribution of phosophoinositides in the bilayer. We observe context-specific differences in lipid diffusion rates, lipid surface densities, and bilayer structure. The molecular-scale delineation of ion-lipid arrangements reported here provides insight into similar nanocluster formation induced by peripheral proteins to regulate the formation of functional signaling complexes on the membrane.", {"entities": [[0, 16, "MOL"], [25, 42, "MOL"], [248, 265, "MOL"], [300, 316, "MOL"], [379, 395, "MOL"], [410, 427, "MOL"], [429, 436, "MOL"], [638, 678, "MOL"], [691, 731, "MOL"], [807, 809, "MOL"], [836, 838, "MOL"], [971, 989, "MOL"]]}]]}
