Although their chemical behavior in solution is relatively well understood, they may behave very differently at the water/air interface of atmospheric aerosols or at the membrane/water interface of cells. Here, we developed a fully classical model for molecular dynamics simulations of NO3 , NO2 , HNO3, and HNO2 in the framework of the GROMOS 53A6 and 54A7 force field versions. The model successfully accounted for the poorly structured solvation shell and ion pairing tendency of NO3 . Accurate pure-liquid properties and hydration free energies were obtained for the oxyacids. Simulations at the water/air interface showed a local enrichment of HNO3 and depletion of NO3 . The effect was discussed in light of earlier spectroscopic data and ab initio calculations, suggesting that HNO3 behaves as a weaker acid at the surface of water. Our model will hopefully allow for efficient and accurate simulations of nitrogen oxyanions and oxyacids in solution and at microheterogeneous interface environments.", {"entities": [[54, 72, "MOL"], [77, 85, "MOL"], [144, 162, "MOL"], [167, 175, "MOL"], [359, 364, "MOL"], [365, 368, "MOL"], [422, 427, "MOL"], [529, 532, "MOL"], [535, 538, "MOL"], [541, 545, "MOL"], [551, 555, "MOL"], [580, 591, "FFM"], [726, 729, "MOL"], [814, 822, "MOL"], [843, 848, "MOL"], [849, 852, "MOL"], [892, 896, "MOL"], [914, 917, "MOL"], [1028, 1032, "MOL"], [1076, 1081, "MOL"], [1156, 1174, "MOL"], [1179, 1187, "MOL"]]}]]}
