Connexin-46/50 in a dynamic lipid environment resolved by CryoEM at 1.9 A 
These are the molecular dynamics (MD) data that are analyzed, in Flores et al. 2020. Each trajectory file (.dcd) has an associated structure file (.psf), which can be analyzed in VMD. Each gap junction system, Cx46 & Cx50, were simulated with either KCl or NaCl in the intracellular space: Cx46 KCl/NaCl, Cx50 KCl/NaCl. All four systems were equilibrated for 30ns and then followed up with 2 separate 100ns production runs. For MD lipid-densities the Cx50 KCl system was used as the representative dataset. Lipid densities from all other systems can be calculated with the provided TCL script calc-density.tcl.
