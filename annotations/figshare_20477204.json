All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of GQs are computationally challenging due to slow folding times and force field (ff) artifacts. In an earlier study, a direct folding simulation of the simplest DNA GQ (TBA15) was first reported using a modified version of the AMBER bsc1 ff (bsc1 vdW ff). Despite this successful folding simulation, it was later found that the bsc1 vdW ff is somewhat limited in terms of describing loop structures of GQs, which is problematic because GQ loop regions play key roles in ligand binding to modulate GQ activities. In this study, we further modified the bsc1 vdW ff to enhance the GQ loop prediction by fine-tuning a limited number of van der Waals (vdW) parameters of the standard AMBER bsc1 ff to improve the GQ loop distribution of a target GQ system (three-layered antiparallel GQ; mHtel21). Test simulations of this newly generated ff (bsc1 vdWL ff) on DNA GQs with diverse topologies (hybrid1, hybrid2, and parallel propeller) revealed that loop structures were predicted more accurately than by the bsc1 vdW ff. We consider that enhanced sampling MD simulation methods in combination with bsc1 vdWL provide useful simulation protocols for resolving outstanding issues of DNA GQ folding and GQ/ligand binding at the all-atom level.", {"entities": []}]]}
