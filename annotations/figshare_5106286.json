The interface relies on our in-house FORTRAN90 parser, working on the recently released Generalized Amber Force Field parameter set (GAFF2). AM1/BCC charges are computed using the Public Domain MOPAC7 program and the bond charge corrections (BCC) reported in Jakalian, A.; Jack, D. B.; Bayly, C. I.; J. Comp. Chem., 2002, 23, 1623 1641. The interface has been tested on about 52,000 compounds (identified with a CAS registry number) taken from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Open Database. PrimaDORAC has been found to be very reliable, producing GAFF2 minimized structures bearing a mean root square displacement of about 0.01 0.02 nm with respect to the original CORINA-generated 3D NCI structures. As a demonstrative example, we release the full topology and parameter files, along with the AM1/BCC-GAFF2 computed in vacuo IR spectrum, for some recently discovered PARP/MCL1 inhibitors. The web interface and parser, including the sources, are part of the ORAC code (Procacci, P.; J. Chem. Inf.
