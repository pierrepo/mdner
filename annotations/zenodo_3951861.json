Each trajectory file (.dcd) has an associated structure file (.psf), which can be analyzed in VMD. Each gap junction system, Cx46 & Cx50, were simulated with either KCl or NaCl in the intracellular space: Cx46 KCl/NaCl, Cx50 KCl/NaCl. All four systems were equilibrated for 30ns and then followed up with 2 separate 100ns production runs. For MD lipid-densities the Cx50 KCl system was used as the representative dataset. Lipid densities from all other systems can be calculated with the provided TCL script calc-density.tcl.
