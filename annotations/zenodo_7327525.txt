Raw data for: Cell-free biosynthesis combined with deep learning accelerates de novo-development of antimicrobial peptides
This repository contains data related to "Cell-free biosynthesis combined with deep learning accelerates de novo-development of antimicrobial peptides" by Pandi et al. Included are molecular dynamics parameter files, initial structures after system equilibration and production trajectories. For simulations of AMPs with membranes, trajectories are subsampled with 1 frame every 5 ns and final structures after 1 μs of production simulation are included. Contact information: Name: Stefan L.
