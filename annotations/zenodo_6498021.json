The dataset contains data of 73 alchemical simulations and is subdivided in 10 zip files, one for each of the systems considered in this work Folders are named following the scheme: system configuration forcefield, or 1M system configuration forcefield for simulation performed at 1 M salt concentrations Each folder contains: - topology files (topol.top, topol RNA chain A.itp, topol RNA chain B.itp) - .mdp files for each replica - index files needed to reconstruct the demuxed trajectories (replica index.xvg , replica index.xvg) - 20 .edr files corresponding to energies for the concatenated trajectory computed for 20 set of DeQs drawn from a gaussian distribution - 16 folders, one for each replica (lam0 ... lam15), containing: - final configuration (confout.gro) - log file (md.log) - dhdl.xvg files needed for computing Free Energies via \"gmx bar\" command - energies relative to the single replica (ener.edr) - energies for the concatenated trajectories recomputed for the realtive replica hamiltonian (ener trj conc.edr).
