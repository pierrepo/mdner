In Martini simulations (15 us, last 5 us analyzed) of an asymmetric GM1+POPC lipid bilayer (5+95 upper, 0+100 lower leaflet)\u00a0strong stress fluctuations arising from the dihedral contributions of CCF decomposition are found. It is\u00a0possible\u00a0that these are due to a slight\u00a0bug in the GROMACS-LS (https://removed code, because: 1) The fluctuations do not show converge, when more data is added, see the attached plot \u2018effect of sampling rate.pdf\u2019. 2) The fluctuations (but no other features of the stress profiles) visibly depend on the chosen frame of reference, see \u2018effect of centering schemes.pdf\u2019. 3) The stress profiles calculated along the coordinates that lay in the membrane plane (x and y), are not constant in CCFD, see \u2018profiles along x and y.pdf\u2019. \u00a0 To assist debugging the code, this repository contains: 5to95 0to100 0.trr ---\u00a01st 33.3% of a\u00a05 us trajectory with snapshots every 100 ps 5to95 0to100 0.trr ---\u00a02nd\u00a033.3% of a\u00a05 us trajectory with snapshots every 100 ps 5to95 0to100 0.trr --- 3rd\u00a033.3% of a\u00a05 us trajectory with snapshots every 100 ps 5to95 0to100.tpr --- tpr used for production (Gromacs 5.1.1) 5to95 0to100 rerun.tpr --- tpr used for stress analysis and centering 5to95 0to100.gro --- gro file after 15 us (10 us relaxation, 5 us production) index.ndx --- index file used in production 5to95 0to100.ndx --- index file used in analysis system.top --- topology file martini v2.0 ions.itp --- martini FF file (system.top expects this to be in folder toppar/) martini v2.0 lipids all 201506.itp --- martini FF file (system.top expects this to be in folder toppar/) martini v2.2.itp --- martini FF file (system.top expects this to be in folder toppar/) martini straight GM1 saveVels.mdp --- run input file used for production (Gromacs 5.1.1) martini straight GM1 rerunForP.mdp --- run input\u00a0file used for analysis and centering effect of sampling rate.pdf\u00a0--- plot of results\u00a0showing that\u00a0fluctuations in CCFD do not appear to converge when data is added profiles along x and y.pdf ---\u00a0plot of results showing that\u00a0in CCFD pressure profiles along the membrane directions are not constant effect of centering schemes.pdf\u00a0---\u00a0plot of results showing that\u00a0choice of center of mass (here three possibilities are shown: CoM of POPC GL1 beads,\u00a0CoM of POPCs, and CoM of all lipids)\u00a0visibly\u00a0affects CCFD fluctuations, but not other features of the stress profile effect of centering schemes 2.pdf\u00a0---\u00a0plot of results (similar to\u00a0'effect of centering schemes.pdf', but the center of the bilayer is at 3.7 nm instead at 0.0 /\u00a07.4 nm) individual components.pdf\u00a0---\u00a0plot of results showing that the fluctuations in CCFD arise from dihedrals CCFD gridsize.pdf\u00a0---\u00a0plot of results showing that decreasing gridsize has no clear effect on the CCFD fluctuations", {"entities": [[42, 52, "SOFTWARE"], [57, 64, "MODEL"], [122, 130, "MOLECULE"], [131, 136, "MOLECULE"], [335, 345, "MODEL"], [1472, 1479, "MODEL"], [1538, 1545, "MODEL"], [1551, 1557, "MOLECULE"], [1577, 1584, "MODEL"], [1643, 1650, "MODEL"], [1664, 1671, "MODEL"], [1730, 1737, "MODEL"], [1804, 1817, "SOFTWARE"], [1819, 1826, "MODEL"], [2299, 2303, "MOLECULE"], [2322, 2327, "MOLECULE"], [2344, 2350, "MOLECULE"]]}]]}
