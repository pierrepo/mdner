{"classes": ["TEMP", "SOFT", "STIME", "MOL", "FFM"], "annotations": [["Bug in CCFD stress profile calculation of GROMACS-LS?\nIn Martini simulations (15 \u03bcs, last 5 \u03bcs analyzed) of an asymmetric GM1 + POPC lipid bilayer (5+95 upper, 0+100 lower leaflet) strong stress fluctuations arising from the dihedral contributions of CCF decomposition are found. It is possible that these are due to a slight bug in the GROMACS-LS (http://mdstress.org) code, because: 1) The fluctuations do not show converge, when more data is added, see the attached plot effect of sampling rate.pdf . 2) The fluctuations (but no other features of the stress profiles) visibly depend on the chosen frame of reference, see effect of centering schemes.pdf . 3) The stress profiles calculated along the coordinates that lay in the membrane plane (x and y), are not constant in CCFD, see profiles along x and y.pdf .
