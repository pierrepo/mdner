Critical to this process are the neuronal SNAREs (Soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor Attachment protein REceptor), the Ca2+-sensor synaptotagmin, the activator/regulator complexin, and other factors. Here we present the data for molecular dynamics simulations of the tripartite interface bewteen these proteins.
