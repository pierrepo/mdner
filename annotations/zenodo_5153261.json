The final structures of some of the simulations were used to perform in-silico docking with ACE2 receptor to evaluate the effect of comformational changes (docking was perform with PyDOCK). The file trajectories 6vsb dt1ns.zip contains trajectories of simulations that were performed on a segment of the Protein Data Bank ID 6VSB comprising RBD, SD1 and SD2. The file trajectories 6m0j dt1ns.zip correspond to the RBD in Protein Data Bank ID 6M0J. The file trajectories in-silico mutations dt1ns.zip correspond to simulations performed on in-silico generated mutations following the mutations corresponding to WHO Variants of Concern UK, South Africa and Brazil. In all cases, simulations were performed at different electric field intensities ranging between 104 V/m and 107 V/m, with an extra short simulation under very high intensity (109 V/m). The file docked structures 6m0j.zip contains the 100 best scored docked structures for each case as the output of PyDOCK. Trajectories are stored in GROMACS compressed trajectory file format (.xtc), downsampled to a 1ns timestep. Individual trajectories length are between 300 nanoseconds and 1 microsecond. In-silico docked structures are in PDB format.
