Initial structures generated with the HADDOCK v2.4 web server with 3 nm\u00a0distance restraints for lysine pairs\u00a0that were experimentally found to be cross-linked with\u00a0DSS.\u00a0 Five clusters and the\u00a0four representative structures provided by HADDOCK were then used for atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. These structures were solvated and simulated with both\u00a0CHARMM36m and Amber FF14SB force fields\u00a0for 250 ns each using GROMACS 2021. The recommended simulation parameters were used for both force fields, and they are available in the mdp files.\u00a0 For each of these 5 (clusters) x\u00a04 (structures per cluster) x\u00a02\u00a0(force fields) = 40 simulations, the outputs and inputs are provided; the\u00a0trajectory (xtc), energy file (edr), final structure (gro), run parameter file (tpr), and continue point (cpt) are system-specific, whereas a single topology (top) and index file (ndx) is shared among all simulations with the same force field. The molecule definitions (itp) referred to in the topology are provided in the compressed files.", {"entities": [[34, 51, "SOFT"], [74, 79, "MOL"], [84, 92, "MOL"], [161, 172, "MOL"], [220, 232, "SOFT"], [278, 284, "MOL"], [417, 424, "SOFT"], [541, 550, "FFM"], [555, 567, "FFM"], [585, 591, "STIME"], [603, 616, "SOFT"]]}]]}
