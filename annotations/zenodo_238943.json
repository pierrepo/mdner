The nanoparticle is pulled to the EC leaflet in the 'genstart' simulations. The initial structures for the umbrella sampling windows are extracted from this trajectory. The files obtained from umbrella\u00a0sampling windows are named 'pullX.*', where X is the distance between the centers of mass of the AuNP and the EC leaflet phosphori. Trajectories (.xtc) are saved every 100ps. Additionally, the initial and final structures (.gro), the run input files (.tpr), energy files (.edr), log files (.log), checkpoint files (.cpt),\u00a0simulation parameter files (.mdp), and the files generated by the pull code (pull forces and pull distances, .xvg)\u00a0are given for each umbrella window. Additionally,\u00a0an index file (index.ndx) and a topology file\u00a0(topol.top) common for all systems is provided. TOP.tar contains the molecule definitions (.itp). 'pullf-files.dat' and 'tpr-files.dat' are used by g wham to extract the profile shown in Fig. 3 (except for the choice of the zero level) by 'g wham -it tpr-files.dat -if pullf-files.dat -b 40000 -nBootstrap 100' [1] Heikkil\u00e4 et al., Cationic Au Nanoparticle Binding with Plasma Membrane-like Lipid Bilayers: Potential Mechanism for Spontaneous Permeation to Cells Revealed by Atomistic Simulations, J.
