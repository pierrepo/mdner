These supplementary videos include rendered videos of those trajectories (named: mutant equilibrationtime pull.mp4), principal component trajectories (named: mutant equilibrationtime pcx.mp4), and the control trajectory with pull from termini (named: termini control.mp4). These are template names for the video trajectories (refer to README file for more details). Note, mutants refer to the in silico mutations made to the TCR-pMHC protein structures and are abbreviated L1, MART1, and GVA, respectively. In addition, the starting configurations for all pull simulations have been provided free of charge.", {"entities": [[52, 67, "MOL"], [140, 148, "MOL"], [626, 634, "MOL"], [674, 676, "MOL"], [678, 683, "MOL"], [689, 692, "MOL"]]}]]}
