Amyloid fibrils can develop from a variety of proteins in the body as they misfold into a primarily -sheet structure and aggregate. Human lysozyme has been shown to have far reaching effects in the human health a homologous enzyme, hen egg-white lysozyme, has been shown to denature to a primarily -sheet structure at low pH and high alcohol content solution. We have studied these systems in atomic-level detail with a combination of constant pH and microsecond long molecular dynamics simulation in explicit solvent, which cumulatively total over 10 Î¼s of simulation time. These studies have allowed us to determine two potential unfolding pathways depending on the protonation state of a key glutamic acid residue as well as the effect of solution dynamics and pH on the unfolding process.", {"entities": [[26, 44, "MOL"]]}]]}
