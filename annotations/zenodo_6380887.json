Each system has been simulated at two temperatures, 300 K and 340 K. Starting configurations of the proteins after equilibration are provided for all the systems in GRO Gromos87 format. Trajectories with the positions of the proteins every 100 ps are provided for all the systems in XTC gromacs format.", {"entities": [[91, 111, "MOL"], [305, 325, "MOL"], [524, 529, "MOL"], [601, 606, "TEMP"], [611, 617, "TEMP"], [649, 657, "MOL"], [718, 726, "FFM"], [774, 782, "MOL"], [836, 843, "SOFT"]]}]]}
