Conserved Water Networks Identification for Drug Design Using Density Clustering Approaches on Positional and Orientational Data
This work describes the development and testing of a method for the identification and classification of conserved water molecules and their networks from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The conserved waters in the active sites of proteins influence protein ligand binding. Recently, several groups have argued that a water network formed from conserved waters can be used to interpret the thermodynamic signature of the binding site. We implemented a novel methodology in which we apply the complex approach to categorize water molecules extracted from the MD simulation trajectories using clustering approaches. The main advantage of our methodology as compared to current state of the art approaches is the inclusion of the information on the orientation of hydrogen atoms to further inform the clustering algorithm and to classify the conserved waters into different subtypes depending on how strongly certain orientations are preferred. This information is vital for assessing the stability of water networks. The newly developed approach is described in detail as well as validated against known results from the scientific literature including comparisons with the experimental data on thermolysin, thrombin, and Haemophilus influenzae virulence protein SiaP as well as with the previous computational results on thermolysin. We observed excellent agreement with the literature and were also able to provide additional insights into the orientations of the conserved water molecules, highlighting the key interactions which stabilize them. The source code of our approach, as well as the utility tools used for visualization, are freely available on GitHub.
