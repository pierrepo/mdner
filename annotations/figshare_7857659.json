As the activation determinants of the receptor remain unknown, we simulated an unliganded receptor and two small-molecular ligands, the antagonist suvorexant and the agonist Nag26 for comparison. Each system was simulated in pure POPC membrane as well as in the 25% cholesterol POPC membrane. In total, we carried out 36 \u03bcs of simulations. Through this set of simulations, we report a stable binding mode for the C-terminus of orexin-A . In addition, we suggest interactions that would promote orexin receptor activation, as well as others that would stabilize the inactive state.", {"entities": [[16, 31, "MOL"], [169, 177, "MOL"], [185, 197, "MOL"], [422, 427, "MOL"], [478, 482, "MOL"], [514, 525, "MOL"], [526, 530, "MOL"], [566, 571, "STIME"], [675, 683, "MOL"], [742, 757, "MOL"]]}]]}
