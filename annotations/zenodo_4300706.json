More information on the module can be found on its website. The training files are named dppc gel.gro and dppc fluid.gro. They respectively correspond to the final frame of the systems simulated at 288K and 358K. All other files are the files analysed by the module. System composition: DPPC molecules: 256 with 130 atoms each Water molecules: 42,492 with 3 atoms each Simulation box dimensions (approx.): 9 x 9 x 20 nm Simulation details: Software: Gromacs (v. 2020) Forcefield: Charmm36 (v.
