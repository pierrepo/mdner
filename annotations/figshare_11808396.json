The starting positions of the ligand (LP1, LP2, LP3) derive from docking experiments.The suffixes (a, b, c) on the filenames represent the replicates of the same MD simulation using random initial velocities.The archives contain also an heatmap representing the protein-ligand contact frequencies. Green-boxed occurrences in the heatmap represent hydrogen bond occurrences during the simulation.Note: The refined crystal structure of the protease of our partner Prof. Yang group from ShanghaiTech is oficially released: https://removed 1 of 5:XHD LC1aXHD LC1b+ images of the 3 docked starting positions", {"entities": [[48, 53, "STIME"], [75, 105, "MOL"], [179, 188, "MOL"], [222, 228, "STIME"], [235, 240, "TEMP"], [324, 354, "MOL"], [387, 396, "MOL"], [853, 861, "MOL"]]}]]}
