Molecular dynamics trajectories of protein folding
Molecular dynamics trajectories of protein folding are deposited for educational purposes. Currently, the following trajectories are available: Chignolin (five independent NVT simulations up to 1.5 micro-sec): 'movie.pse' is a PyMOL session file of MD trajectories. 'movie.mp4' is a movie file that shows you how a protein folds during simulation. xtc files (Gromacs compressed format) and corresponding tpr files. gro files for movie making Computational setting Amber ff99SB-ILDN for protein (Lindorff-Larsen, K. et al.
