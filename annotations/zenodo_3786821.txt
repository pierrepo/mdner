Inputs for computational electrophysiology of the Glycine Receptor with GROMACS 19
Inputs for computational electrophysiology of the Glycine Receptor (D&B-open model, doi:10.5281/zenodo.3476169) with GROMACS 19 and the CHARMM36 force-field, using: 1- a single membrane system with the application of a constant electric field. 2- a double membrane system with the application of the charge imbalance protocol. The model of the glycine receptor was reduced to its transmembrane domain and simulated with atomic positional restraints.
