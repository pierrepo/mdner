It remains unclear how this supercoiling affects the detailed double-helical structure of DNA, largely because of limitations in spatial resolution of the available biophysical tools. In this study, the authors combined high-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reveal how supercoiling affects global and local DNA conformation, structure and dynamics in DNA minicircles of length 250-340 bp. The following procedures are described in more detail in the related article: generation and purification of small DNA circles, preparation and analysis of different topological species of minicircles, S1 nuclease digestions, atomic force microscopy, atomistic simulations and surface plasmon resonance.
