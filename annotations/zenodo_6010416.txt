Source molecular simulation data for calculating energy and friction profiles and permeability coefficients through model lipid membranes
Energy files from GROMACS molecular dynamics simulations with enhanced free energy sampling contain time-dependent evolution of the free energy profiles and friction profiles (and other energies and simulation properties) that were used for calculating permeability coefficients in the publication https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.16.452599v1 Simulation system contains a lipid POPC or DPPC bilayer with a varying amount of cholesterol (specified as mol% in the file name). Hydrophobic level of the permeating particle is specified as "level-I", "level-II" etc. When unspecified in the file name, the particle is hydrophobic level "III". Lipids D-C14-PC denote PC lipids with both tails monounsaturated of length 14 carbon atoms. DOPC is equivalent to D-C18-PC. (Detailed description in the publication) Adaptive Weighted Histogram (AWH) method was used to sample the free energy profile of translocating small molecule through the lipid bilayer. GROMACS tool 'gmx awh' reads the files and provides the described profiles. Files were generated by GROMACS 'mdrun' simulation engine version 2019.3. Coarse-grained MARTINI 3.0 model was used for modeling the biomolecular interactions. Scripts to perform the simulations and the files with initial configurations and simulation settings are stored in a public GitHub repository depozited on Zenodo.org: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5082249.
