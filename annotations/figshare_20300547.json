To investigate the effects of the chain length of the alkyl groups on the structure and properties of AGO-based materials, we performed two-step simulations, involving (1) equilibration of layered AGOs and (2) tensile tests. The results showed that longer alkyl chains reduce the interlayer distance and increase the density of the layered structure. Young s moduli of the layered structures were evaluated using the developed method and were found to increase with increasing alkyl chain length.", {"entities": [[36, 50, "MOL"], [220, 235, "MOL"], [237, 241, "MOL"], [314, 318, "MOL"], [407, 410, "MOL"], [610, 615, "MOL"], [658, 661, "MOL"], [753, 757, "MOL"], [812, 817, "MOL"], [1033, 1038, "MOL"]]}]]}
