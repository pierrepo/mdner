Here, we use force field molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations with density functional theory and XMCQDPT2 methods to investigate the effect of the five most probable protonation forms of BV on structural stability, binding pocket interactions, and absorption spectra in the two photochromic states of DrBphP. While agreement with X-ray structural data and measured UV/vis spectra suggest that in both states the protonated form of the chromophore dominates, we also find that a minor population with a deprotonated D-ring could contribute to the red-shifted tail in the absorption spectra.", {"entities": [[19, 32, "MOL"], [116, 140, "MOL"], [141, 154, "MOL"], [156, 158, "MOL"], [604, 606, "MOL"]]}]]}
