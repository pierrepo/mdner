Simulation data for CHARMM36 POPC bilayer, 100 lipids/leaflet, 310K, GROMACS 5.1.4 Simulations of a POPC bilayer without ions with CHARMM36 FF from the CHARMM-Gui.  The first from the set of 6 simulations. The goal was to study the effect of scaling the CHARMM FF on the ion binding.   Done for the NMRlipids project, see  https://removed for more information. A POPC bilayer consisting of 200 lipids (100 per leaflet)  is simulated. The Charmm36  model  is employed for lipids, the Charmm compatible variant  of the tip3p model for water. The Charmm36 force field parameters were obtained from https://removed –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– The files are in GROMACS format.
