Tilted State Population of Antimicrobial Peptide PGLa Is Coupled to the Transmembrane Potential
Cationic antimicrobial peptide PGLa gets into close contact with the anionic bacterial cell membrane, facilitating cross-membrane transport phenomena and membrane disruption depending on the concentration. The mechanisms of action are closely associated with the tilted insertion geometry of PGLa. Therefore, we aimed to understand the interaction between the transmembrane potential (TMP) and the orientation of the membrane-bound PGLa helix. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed with TMP, and we found that the PGLa tilt angle relative to the membrane is coupled with the TMP. Elevated TMP increases the population of the tilted state. We observed positive feedback between the tilt angle and the TMP, which occurs due to the electrostatic interaction between the peptidic helix and the Na+ cations at the membrane water interface. These TMP coupled phenomena can contribute to understanding the direct antimicrobial and adjuvant effects of PGLa in combination with regular antibiotics.
