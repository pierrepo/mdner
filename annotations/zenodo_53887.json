Nanofluids generally exhibit higher thermal conductivities, as compared to conventional fluids. Therefore, they are interesting to applications, in which thermal conductivity is a cornerstone. Hereby, molecular dynamics simulations were used to study an energy exchange in one of the possible nanofluids: N-butylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate based solution of nanodiamonds. The data are given in the form of energy components versus time and atomistic trajectories versus time at a number of temperatures. The simulations were conducted in the constant energy ensemble to avoid efects of temperature coupling and pressure coupling. The dataset possesses both research and educational values.", {"entities": [[68, 79, "MOL"], [84, 119, "MOL"], [533, 568, "MOL"], [587, 599, "MOL"]]}]]}
