Uridine was replaced with N1-Methylpseudouridine. The parameters were not included in the standard CHARMM36 forcefield (version July 2020) and were manually added to the forcefield. - topology/ALC SHORT CORRECT IDX.itp - Parameters for the capped PEG-ylated lipid ALC-0159 -> Parameters were manually adapted to fit the shortened structure. - topology/charmm36-jul2020.ff - CHARMM36 forcefield parameters (version July 2020) with included parameters for N1-Methylpseudouridine. - topology/cgenff output - Output from the CGenFF-Webserver to parametrize the aminolipid (ALC-0315) and the PEGylated-lipid (ALC-0159)
