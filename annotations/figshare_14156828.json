While vaccination has started and several clinical trials for a number of vaccines are currently underway, there is a pressing need for a cure for those already infected with the virus. Of particular interest in the design of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics is the human protein angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) to which this virus adheres before entry into the host cell. The SARS-CoV-2 virion binds to cell-surface bound ACE2 via interactions of the spike protein (s-protein) on the viral surface with ACE2. In this paper, we use all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and binding enthalpy calculations to determine the effect that a bound ACE2 active site inhibitor (MLN-4760) would have on the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 s-protein with ACE2. Our analysis indicates that the binding enthalpy could be reduced for s-protein adherence to the active site inhibitor-bound ACE2 protein by as much as 1.48-fold as an upper limit. This weakening of binding strength was observed to be due to the destabilization of the interactions between ACE2 residues Glu-35, Glu-37, Tyr-83, Lys-353, and Arg-393 and the SARS-CoV-2 s-protein receptor binding domain (RBD). The conformational changes were shown to lead to weakening of ACE2 interactions with SARS-CoV-2 s-protein, therefore reducing s-protein binding strength. Further, we observed increased conformational lability of the N-terminal helix and a conformational shift of a significant portion of the ACE2 motifs involved in s-protein binding, which may affect the kinetics of the s-protein binding when the small molecule inhibitor is bound to the ACE2 active site. These observations suggest potential new ways for interfering with the SARS-CoV-2 adhesion by modulating ACE2 conformation through distal active site inhibitor binding.", {"entities": [[62, 66, "MOLECULE"], [86, 99, "MOLECULE"], [103, 113, "MOLECULE"], [124, 127, "MOLECULE"], [135, 183, "MOLECULE"], [185, 195, "MOLECULE"], [580, 595, "MOLECULE"], [630, 662, "MOLECULE"], [664, 668, "MOLECULE"], [735, 745, "MOLECULE"], [781, 785, "MOLECULE"], [810, 823, "MOLECULE"], [825, 834, "MOLECULE"], [862, 867, "MOLECULE"], [1001, 1005, "MOLECULE"], [1029, 1037, "MOLECULE"], [1077, 1087, "MOLECULE"], [1088, 1097, "MOLECULE"], [1103, 1108, "MOLECULE"], [1179, 1188, "MOLECULE"], [1234, 1238, "MOLECULE"], [1399, 1403, "MOLECULE"], [1413, 1419, "MOLECULE"], [1421, 1427, "MOLECULE"], [1429, 1435, "MOLECULE"], [1437, 1444, "MOLECULE"], [1450, 1457, "MOLECULE"], [1466, 1476, "MOLECULE"], [1477, 1486, "MOLECULE"], [1580, 1584, "MOLECULE"], [1603, 1613, "MOLECULE"], [1614, 1623, "MOLECULE"], [1810, 1814, "MOLECULE"], [1834, 1843, "MOLECULE"], [1890, 1899, "MOLECULE"], [1958, 1962, "MOLECULE"], [2047, 2057, "MOLECULE"], [2081, 2085, "MOLECULE"]]}]]}
