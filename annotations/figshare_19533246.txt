AIM: A Mapping Program for Infrared Spectroscopy of Proteins
Here, we present a new analysis program, AIM, that allows extracting the vibrational amide-I Hamiltonian using molecular dynamics trajectories for protein infrared spectroscopy modeling. The constructed Hamiltonians can be used as input for spectral calculations allowing the calculation of infrared absorption spectra, vibrational circular dichroism, and two-dimensional infrared spectra. These spectroscopies allow the study of the structure and dynamics of proteins. We will explain the essence of how AIM works and give examples of the information and spectra that can be obtained with the program using the Trypsin Inhibitor as an example. AIM is freely available from GitHub, and the package contains a demonstration allowing easy introduction to the use of the program.
