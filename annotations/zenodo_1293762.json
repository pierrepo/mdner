Simulations were performed with the standard 43A1-S3 settings: a 1.0\u00a0nm cut-off with PME for the Coulombic interactions and a twin-range 1.0/1.6 nm cut-off for the van der Waals interactions. These simulations were performed at 313 K with a 128 lipid bilayer and used anisotropic pressure coupling. The full trajectories are provided bar\u00a0the initial 100 ns. The starting structure was made through\u00a0the conversion of an equilibrated GROMOS 43A1-S3 POPC membrane.", {"entities": [[0, 14, "MODEL"], [15, 19, "MOLECULE"], [51, 56, "TEMPERATURE"], [99, 113, "MODEL"], [114, 118, "MOLECULE"], [155, 168, "SOFTWARE"], [173, 179, "SIMULATION TIME"], [444, 449, "TEMPERATURE"], [461, 466, "MOLECULE"], [566, 573, "SIMULATION TIME"], [648, 662, "MODEL"], [663, 667, "MOLECULE"]]}]]}
