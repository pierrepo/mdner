The folder contains also the generalized correlation coefficients (Fig. S43) and the correlation scores (Fig. 4, S44, S45), computed from the mutual informations. - networks: communities - for each cluster, each residue is assigned to a community within the interaction network (Fig. S32, S33). betweenness - the values of edge betweenness for each cluster (S30, S31). - output clustering: each frame of the apo and holo simulations is assigned a cluster index, on the basis of the structural similarity (Fig. S4). - PAD: per-residue values of PAD parameter, for apo and holo systems (Fig. 3, S39). - PCA: principal component analysis for each conformational cluster (Section S2.1). - representative structures: representative structures for each conformational cluster (Fig. 2). - r gyr antibody: radii of gyration of the antibody, for each cluster (Fig. 2). - r gyr hinge: radii of gyration of the sole hinge segment, for each cluster (Fig. S36). - RMSD antibody: distributions of the root-mean-square deviation of the antibody, for each cluster (Fig. S5).\u00a0 - RMSD antigen: root-mean-square deviation of the antigen PD-1, for each cluster (Fig. S42). - RMSD binding site: distributions of the root-mean-square deviation of the residues belonging to the paratope, for each cluster (Fig. S40, S47). - RMSD matrix: root-mean-square deviation between structures belonging to different pairs of clusters (Fig. S9). - rmsf antigen: root-mean-square fluctuation of the antigen PD-1, for each cluster (Fig. S42). - rmsf hinge: difference between the total root-mean-square fluctuations of the two hinge segments, for each cluster (Fig. S38). - salt bridge: distribution of distances between residues R979 and D1377 (Fig. 4). - sasa domains: contact area between Fab and Fc antibody domains, for each cluster (Fig. S8). - sasa hinge: solvent accessible surface area of each hinge segment, for each cluster (Fig. S37).", {"entities": [[139, 143, "MOLECULE"], [144, 152, "MOLECULE"], [460, 468, "MOLECULE"], [539, 546, "MOLECULE"], [555, 563, "MOLECULE"], [685, 693, "MOLECULE"], [1539, 1547, "MOLECULE"], [1672, 1680, "MOLECULE"], [1737, 1745, "MOLECULE"], [1783, 1790, "MOLECULE"], [1971, 1979, "MOLECULE"], [2180, 2187, "MOLECULE"], [2401, 2409, "MOLECULE"], [2483, 2491, "MOLECULE"]]}]]}
