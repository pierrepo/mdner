The preprint version is available at: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.07.14.500085 The uploaded zip file \"trajectory data.zip\" contains trajectories for the (1) apo (2) h3k27ac and (3) h3k9ac systems. In each directory is a subdirectory corresponding to the wild-type, deletion, and insertion mutations. In each of those subdirectories are 10 XTC files, which correspond to the trajectories for the 10 different simulations performed for each system, along with an AMBER-formated PRMTOP file. Solvent molecules were removed from each file, and trajectories were strided such that there is one frame per 500 ps.
