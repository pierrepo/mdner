MD simulations of P-glycoprotein started from three different crystal strucures: 3G5U, 4M1M and 4KSB
Molecular simulations of mouse P-glycoprotein started from three different crystal structures with PDB IDs corresponding to 3G5U, 4KSB and 4M1M . The protein was transferred to POPC/cholesterol bilayer, followed by energy minimization and 10 ns equilibration period. All the simulations were performed in Gromacs 3.3.3 in conjunction with GROMOS54a7 force field at 300 K and pressure of 1 bar. Each system was run in triplicates for 200 ns. The uploaded fileset contains: - MD protocol used to run simulations for 3G5U, 4M1M and 4KSB systems; - Example input file for a production run for each system (3G5U run1.mdp, 4M1M run1.mdp, 4KSB run1.mdp); - System topologies (3G5U memb.top, 4M1M memb.top, 4KSB memb.top) and relevant parameter files (3g5u.itp, 4m1m.itp, 4ksb.itp, CLR.itp, POPC.itp, vdw OML CH3L.itp); - Set of three trajectories containing membrane-embedded P-glycoprotein with 1000 frames for each simulated system (snapshots printed every 200 ps); - Movies generated from each trajectory with a more detailed description provided in Movie Legends.pdf; - Model data calculated using principal component analysis method, including the covariance matrices, for each replica (3G5U1-3.eda.npz, 4KSB1-3.eda.npz, 4M1M1-3.eda.npz) and for the concatenated trajectory containing all 9 replicas (3G5U 4KSB 4M1M.eda.npz). The files containing data for the transmembrane domain only have the tmd prefix. These models can be further explored in ProDy package by using loadModel () function. - Figures representing cholesterol distributions in the upper (dark violet) and lower leaflets (light violet) in all three systems at the beginning and at the end of each simulation.
