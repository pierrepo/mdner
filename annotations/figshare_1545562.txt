Longbow: A Lightweight Remote Job Submission Tool
We present Longbow, a lightweight console-based remote job submission tool and library. Longbow allows the user to quickly and simply run jobs on high performance computing facilities without leaving their familiar desktop environment. Not only does Longbow greatly simplify the management of compute-intensive jobs for experienced researchers, it also lowers the technical barriers surrounding high performance computation for the next generation of scientists and engineers. Longbow has already been used to remotely submit jobs in a number of projects and has the potential to redefine the manner in which high performance computers are used. Longbow can be installed by executing: pip install longbow The code is also contained within Longbow.zip however. In LongbowHosts.zip is an example hosts configuration file which provides the details Longbow needs of the remote resource on which the job will run. Example molecular dynamics jobs including input files are in LongbowExamples.zip. For full details on how to install and use Longbow see the documentation at http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/wikis/index.php/Longbow
