The molecular docking of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 on ChAT suggested three most probable binding clusters for both the A\u03b2 peptides. Thus generating ChAT-A\u03b240 Cluster-0, ChAT-A\u03b240 Cluster-1, ChAT-A\u03b240 Cluster-2 for A\u03b240 peptide on ChAT, likewise ChAT-A\u03b242 Cluster-0, ChAT-A\u03b242 Cluster-1, ChAT-A\u03b242 Cluster-2 were generated for A\u03b242 peptide on ChAT. Each of the folders contains the topology file with a \u2018.gro\u2019 extension and a trajectory file with \u2018.xtc\u2019 extension generated from the 100 ns molecular dynamics performed for each of the clusters mentioned above that were generated from the molecular docking. The folders are named as follows: ChAT AB40 Cluster 0: Containing the topology file (ab40 0.gro) and the trajectory file (ab40 0.xtc) ChAT AB40 Cluster 1: Containing the topology file (ab40 1.gro) and the trajectory file (ab40 1.xtc) ChAT AB40 Cluster 2: Containing the topology file (ab40 2.gro) and the trajectory file (ab40 2.xtc) ChAT AB42 Cluster 0: Containing the topology file (ab42 0.gro) and the trajectory file (ab42 0.xtc) ChAT AB42 Cluster 1: Containing the topology file (ab42 1.gro) and the trajectory file (ab42 1.xtc) ChAT AB42 Cluster 2: Containing the topology file (ab42 2.gro) and the trajectory file (ab42 2.xtc ", {"entities": [[0, 25, "MOLECULE"], [27, 31, "MOLECULE"], [35, 47, "MOLECULE"], [48, 56, "MOLECULE"], [154, 179, "MOLECULE"], [181, 185, "MOLECULE"], [189, 194, "MOLECULE"], [195, 203, "MOLECULE"], [238, 242, "MOLECULE"], [247, 251, "MOLECULE"], [255, 259, "MOLECULE"], [320, 322, "MOLECULE"], [323, 332, "MOLECULE"], [349, 358, "MOLECULE"], [370, 379, "MOLECULE"], [391, 400, "MOLECULE"], [415, 419, "MOLECULE"], [431, 435, "MOLECULE"], [446, 455, "MOLECULE"], [467, 476, "MOLECULE"], [488, 497, "MOLECULE"], [527, 531, "MOLECULE"], [683, 689, "SIMULATION TIME"], [842, 846, "MOLECULE"], [847, 851, "MOLECULE"], [942, 946, "MOLECULE"], [947, 951, "MOLECULE"], [1042, 1046, "MOLECULE"], [1047, 1051, "MOLECULE"], [1093, 1097, "MOLECULE"], [1130, 1134, "MOLECULE"], [1142, 1146, "MOLECULE"], [1147, 1151, "MOLECULE"], [1193, 1197, "MOLECULE"], [1230, 1234, "MOLECULE"], [1242, 1246, "MOLECULE"], [1247, 1251, "MOLECULE"], [1293, 1297, "MOLECULE"], [1330, 1334, "MOLECULE"], [1342, 1346, "MOLECULE"], [1347, 1351, "MOLECULE"], [1393, 1397, "MOLECULE"], [1430, 1434, "MOLECULE"]]}]]}
