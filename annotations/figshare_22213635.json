The thermal rate coefficients of this reaction are calculated using the ring polymer molecular dynamics approach, which can account for the nuclear quantum effects, on a newly developed ab initio potential energy surface (PES). The PES was constructed by fitting a large number of ab initio points at the MP2/cc-pVDZ and CCSD (T)/cc-pVTZ levels using a -machine learning approach. The obtained rate coefficients exhibited a minimum at T 130 K, and this characteristic temperature-dependent behavior qualitatively agreed with the experimental measurements. This study confirms that quantum tunneling plays a significant role in the reaction dynamics along with the existence of the metastable NH3+ H2 pre-reactive complex in the entrance channel of the PES.", {"entities": [[79, 83, "MOL"], [86, 88, "MOL"], [89, 93, "MOL"], [96, 97, "MOL"], [162, 166, "MOL"], [169, 171, "MOL"], [172, 176, "MOL"], [179, 180, "MOL"], [181, 184, "MOL"], [194, 202, "MOL"], [780, 785, "TEMP"], [1035, 1039, "MOL"], [1040, 1042, "MOL"]]}]]}
