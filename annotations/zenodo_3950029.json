Chem. Chem. Phys., 2020, DOI: 10.1039/D0CP02058C Description: Simulation files used to train our machine learning algorithm to identify the thermodynamic phase of individual lipid molecules in a bilayer, as well as the simulation files analysed by the machine learning models. Code source for the ML algorithm can be found on Github. The training files are named gel.gro and fluid.gro. They respectively correspond to the final frame of the systems simulated at 288K and 358K. All other files are the files analysed by the machine learning models.
