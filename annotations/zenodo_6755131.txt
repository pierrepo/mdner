All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase (PAH) tetramer to investigate the impact of two novel heterozygous mutations, p.Y198N and p.Y204F, observed in a classical phenylketonuria patient
Phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase (PAH) tetramer system (Robetta modelling to complete the structure with template PDB ID: 6hyc) with parametrised BH4 ligand (parameters are available in the dataset) and Fe (II) metal ions in a TIP3P water box ionised with 0.15 M KCl were presented as wild-type and carrying two novel mutations as Y198N on dimeric chains A and B, and Y204F on dimeric chains C and D. In addition, E353 and E422 are protonated as predicted by PROPKA. BH4 molecule parametrization was performed by using GAFF, Antechamber and amb2chm par.py program of Amber2018. 5,000-step minimization and 1 ns equilibration were performed by fixing the protein to relax the system. Then, another 5,000-step minimization and 1 ns equilibration were performed without any constraints, except the SHAKE algorithm on water molecules, to relax the protein and system. The production simulations were performed along 100 ns trajectory at 310 K collected under NpT ensemble.
