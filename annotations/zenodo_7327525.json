Included are molecular dynamics parameter files, initial structures after system equilibration and production trajectories. For simulations of AMPs with membranes, trajectories are subsampled with 1 frame every 5 ns and final structures after 1 s of production simulation are included. Contact information: Name: Stefan L.
