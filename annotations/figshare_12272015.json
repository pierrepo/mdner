The system is the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein with glycans modeled on using GLYCAM-Web. SARS-CoV2 spike (S) protein structure A 3D structure of the prefusion form of the S protein (RefSeq: YP 009724390.1, UniProt: P0DTC2 SPIKE SARS2), based on a Cryo-EM structure (PDB code 6VSB), was obtained from the SWISS-MODEL server (swissmodel.expasy.org). The model has 95% coverage (residues 27 to 1146) of the S protein. The site specific glycans used to model a glycoform representative of the data obtained from the S glycoprotein expressed in HEK293 cells, are presented below: Hybrid: DManp 1-6[DManp 1-3]DManp 1-6[DGlcpNAc 1-2DManp 1-3]DManp 1-4DGlcpNAc 1-4DGlcpNAc 1-OH Glycosites: 657 FA2: DGlcpNAc 1-2DManp 1-6[DGlcpNAc 1-2DManp 1-3]DManp 1-4DGlcpNAc 1-4[LFucp 1-6]DGlcpNAc 1-OH Glycosites: 149, 165, 331, 343, 616, 1134 A2: DGlcpNAc 1-2DManp 1-6[DGlcpNAc 1-2DManp 1-3]DManp 1-4DGlcpNAc 1-4DGlcpNAc 1-OH Glycosites: 1098 FA2B: DGlcpNAc 1-2DManp 1-6[DGlcpNAc 1-4][DGlcpNAc 1-2DManp 1-3]DManp 1-4DGlcpNAc 1-4[LFucp 1-6]DGlcpNAc 1-OH Glycosites: 74, 282 M5: DManp 1-6[DManp 1-3]DManp 1-6[DManp 1-3]DManp 1-4DGlcpNAc 1-4DGlcpNAc 1-OH Glycosites: 61, 122, 603, 709, 717, 801, 1074 M8: DManp 1-2DManp 1-6[DManp 1-2DManp 1-3]DManp 1-6[DManp 1-2DManp 1-3]DManp 1-4DGlcpNAc 1-4DGlcpNAc 1-OH Glycosites: 234 Glycan naming system. In cases where the mass spectrometry data allows for multiple structures, such as FA2/FA1B, the glycan with the least ambiguity was selected. For example, FA2 was selected over FA1B, as the position of the single antennae is ambiguous.Dataset supports the following preprint: 3D Models of glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein suggest challenges and opportunities for vaccine development.
