We work with individuals all over campus and at other universities to provide computational support to their research, as well as pursuing our own work on amyloid and IDPs. With this OSF, we give you information on our most commonly used techniques and example methods for generating a shared group, multi-project OSF. For information about our current projects or to view our tutorials, head to the Wiki page. To see some of our published papers and images, along with scripts and files to help you with your own molecular modeling, check our Files. Like what we are doing?
