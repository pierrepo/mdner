For each simulation, the run input file (tpr), topology (top), index (ndx), trajectory (xtc), log file (log), energy file (edr), continue point (cpt), and the final structure (gro) are given. The topology refers to the Gromacs-compatible CHARMM36 force field, available at https://removed ff.shtml#gromacs and to other itp files provided in this upload. The simulation parameters are given in the md.mdp file.", {"entities": [[15, 19, "MOL"], [21, 25, "MOL"], [31, 35, "MOL"], [102, 110, "FFM"], [154, 164, "SOFT"], [183, 189, "STIME"], [196, 208, "SOFT"], [242, 246, "MOL"], [248, 252, "MOL"], [257, 261, "MOL"], [278, 283, "MOL"], [296, 300, "MOL"], [521, 528, "SOFT"], [540, 548, "FFM"]]}]]}
