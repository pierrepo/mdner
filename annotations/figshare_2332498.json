However, little detail is known about the exact mechanisms for drug delivery and the distributions of drug molecules inside the lipid carrier. In the current work, a coarse-grained (CG) liposome model is developed, consisting of over 2500 lipids, with varying degrees of drug loading. For the drug molecule, we chose hypericin, a natural compound proposed for use in photodynamic therapy, for which a CG model was derived and benchmarked against corresponding atomistic membrane bilayer model simulations. Liposomes with 21\u201384 hypericin molecules were generated and subjected to 10 microsecond simulations. Distribution of the hypericins, their orientations within the lipid bilayer, and the potential of mean force for transferring a hypericin molecule from the interior aqueous \u201cdroplet\u201d through the liposome bilayer are reported herein.", {"entities": [[30, 39, "MOLECULE"], [149, 158, "MOLECULE"], [424, 429, "MOLECULE"], [535, 541, "MOLECULE"], [613, 622, "MOLECULE"], [802, 811, "MOLECULE"], [823, 832, "MOLECULE"], [875, 889, "SIMULATION TIME"], [923, 933, "MOLECULE"], [965, 970, "MOLECULE"], [1031, 1040, "MOLECULE"], [1098, 1106, "MOLECULE"]]}]]}
