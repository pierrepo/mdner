Here, we use steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and coarse-grained simulations to estimate the binding affinity of the monoclonal antibodies CR3022 and 4A8 to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and SARS-CoV-2 N-terminal domain (NTD). Consistent with experiments, our SMD and coarse-grained simulations both indicate that CR3022 has a higher affinity for SARS-CoV-2 RBD than 4A8 for the NTD, and the coarse-grained simulations indicate the former binds three times stronger to its respective epitope. This finding shows that CR3022 is a candidate for Covid-19 therapy and is likely a better choice than 4A8. Energetic decomposition of the interaction energies between these two complexes reveals that electrostatic interactions explain the difference in the observed binding affinity between the two complexes. This result could lead to a new approach for developing anti-Covid-19 antibodies in which good candidates must contain charged amino acids in the area of contact with the virus.", {"entities": [[70, 76, "MOL"], [110, 113, "MOL"], [461, 467, "MOL"], [472, 475, "MOL"], [483, 517, "MOL"], [519, 522, "MOL"], [528, 556, "MOL"], [558, 561, "MOL"], [651, 657, "MOL"], [684, 698, "MOL"], [704, 707, "MOL"], [716, 719, "MOL"], [854, 860, "MOL"], [932, 935, "MOL"]]}]]}
