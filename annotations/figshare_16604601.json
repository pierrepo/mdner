{"classes": ["TEMP", "SOFT", "STIME", "MOL", "FFM"], "annotations": [["Molecular View on the Dissociation Pathways and Transactivation Regulation Mechanism of Nonsteroidal GR Ligands\nAs a major drug target for anti-inflammatory therapy, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates a wide range of physiological processes through transactivation (TA) or transrepression. GR TA is involved in many adverse effects of GR-targeting drugs, and therefore, the discovery of novel GR ligands with lower TA activity and longer residence time is quite urgent. Undoubtedly, understanding the ligand dissociation mechanisms and the structural basis of the TA regulation is crucial for the development of novel GR-targeting drugs. Here, we used random accelerated molecular dynamics (RAMD) and funnel metadynamics (FM) simulations to explore the dissociation mechanisms of 5 classic glucocorticoids and 6 nonsteroidal GR ligands. Multiple ligand dissociation pathways were discovered. The classic glucocorticoids exhibit a strong preference for Path I, and most nonsteroidal ligands tend to dissociate along mixed pathways. We also find that the distinct unbinding preferences for AZD2906 and AZD9567, two representative nonsteroidal ligands with similar scaffolds but different TA activities, are primarily determined by their different polar interactions with the surrounding residues. Notably, the binding of AZD9567 poses a substantial impact on the conformation of the GR homodimer interface, which provides a valuable clue to understand the mechanisms of the TA-related side effects induced by the adjustments of the homodimerization process. These findings are critical for the structure-based rational design of novel GR ligands with more potent anti-inflammatory potency and reduced side effects.", {"entities": [[101, 103, "MOL"], [170, 193, "MOL"], [195, 197, "MOL"], [298, 300, "MOL"], [343, 345, "MOL"], [401, 403, "MOL"], [626, 628, "MOL"], [798, 813, "MOL"], [833, 835, "MOL"], [1389, 1391, "MOL"], [1641, 1643, "MOL"]]}]]}
