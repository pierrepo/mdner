However, simulation of these transitions is challenging and therefore often omitted in force field development. Here, we perform a series of benchmarks on seven representative molecular dynamics models (TraPPE, PYS, CHARMM36, L-OPLS, COMPASS, Williams, and the newly optimized Williams 7B), comparing with experimental data for liquid properties, liquid solid, and solid solid phase transitions of two prototypical alkanes, n-pentadecane (C15) and n-hexadecane (C16). We find that existing models overestimate the melting points by up to 34 K, with PYS and Williams 7B yielding the most accurate results deviating only 2 and 3 K from the experiment. We specially design order parameters to identify crystal rotator phase transitions in alkanes. United-atom models could only produce a rotator phase with complete rotational disorder, whereas all-atom models using a 12-6 Lennard-Jones potential show no rotator phase even when superheated above the melting point. In contrast, Williams (Buckingham potential) and COMPASS (9-6 Lennard-Jones) reproduce the crystal-to-rotator phase transition, with the optimized Williams 7B model having the most accurate crystal rotator transition temperature of C15.", {"entities": [[102, 109, "MOL"], [133, 139, "MOL"], [594, 600, "FFM"], [602, 605, "FFM"], [607, 615, "FFM"], [617, 623, "FFM"], [625, 632, "FFM"], [634, 642, "FFM"], [668, 679, "FFM"], [806, 813, "MOL"], [815, 828, "MOL"], [830, 833, "MOL"], [839, 851, "MOL"], [853, 856, "MOL"], [940, 943, "FFM"], [948, 959, "FFM"], [1127, 1134, "MOL"], [1368, 1376, "FFM"], [1404, 1411, "FFM"], [1502, 1513, "FFM"], [1587, 1590, "MOL"]]}]]}
