{"classes": ["TEMP", "SOFT", "STIME", "MOL", "FFM"], "annotations": [["In-Cell Protein Protein Contacts: Transient Interactions in the Crowd\nProteins in vivo are immersed in a crowded environment of water, ions, metabolites, and macromolecules. In-cell experiments highlight how transient weak protein protein interactions promote (via functional quinary structure ) or hinder (via competitive binding or sticking ) complex formation. Computational models of the cytoplasm are expensive. We tackle this challenge with an all-atom model of a small volume of the E. coli cytoplasm to simulate protein protein contacts up to the 5 \u03bcs time scale on the special-purpose supercomputer Anton 2. We use three CHARMM-derived force fields: C22*, C36m, and C36mCU (with CUFIX corrections). We find that both C36m and C36mCU form smaller contact surfaces than C22*. Although CUFIX was developed to reduce protein protein sticking, larger contacts are observed with C36mCU than C36m. We show that the lifespan t of protein protein contacts obeys a power law distribution between 0.03 and 3 s, with 90% of all contacts lasting <1 s (similar to the time scale for downhill folding).", {"entities": [[128, 133, "MOL"], [490, 507, "MOL"], [555, 559, "STIME"], [630, 636, "FFM"], [659, 663, "FFM"], [665, 669, "FFM"], [675, 681, "FFM"], [726, 730, "FFM"], [735, 741, "FFM"], [777, 781, "FFM"], [882, 888, "FFM"], [894, 899, "FFM"]]}]]}
