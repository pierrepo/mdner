Molecular dynamics simulations of lipid bilayers containing POPC and POPS (various mixtures) with ECC-lipids force field, and Na+ (K+) counterions
Classical molecular dynamics simulations of various mixtures of POPC:POPS lipid bilayers in water solution with only Na+ counterions (or with K+ counterions when noted with " KCl" suffix). ECC-lipids force field parameters used for lipids, SPC/E water model and ECC-ions, all parameters available at https://removed lipids simulations performed with Gromacs 2018.0 (*.xtc files) simulation length 1000 ns 1 microsecond temperature 298 K Gromacs simulation setting is in the file npt lipid bilayer.mdp
