This folder contains the files needed to start each of the models described in the paper. The files were created using MOE 2020 software made by Chemical Computing Group and run on NAMD2. The models identifiers in the paper correspond to the following terms in the code: Substrate: \"13 5 coa\" Product: \"13 5 coa desat fe3\" Apoprotein: \"13 5 no ligand\" Saturated Lipid: \"13 5 nocoa\" Desaturated Lipid: \"13 5 nocoa desat fe3\" CoA model: \"13 5 coa nolipid\" Substrate-waterbox model: \"13 5 coa waterbox\" Saturated Lipid-waterbox: \"13 5 nocoa waterbox\"", {"entities": [[38, 61, "MOL"], [194, 217, "MOL"], [431, 439, "SOFT"], [493, 498, "SOFT"]]}]]}
