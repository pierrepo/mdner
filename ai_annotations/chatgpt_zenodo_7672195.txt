All molecular dynamics and molecular docking data presented, analyzed, and discussed in this paper are available at reasonable requests submitted to the corresponding author. The following data are also available online: (i) file <MOL>KRas4B<MOL> pdbs.zip, a compressed archive including coordinate (.pdb) and structure (.psf) files for <MOL>KRas-4B<MOL> <MOL>WT<MOL> and <MOL>D33E<MOL> proteins, (ii) <MOL>KRas4B<MOL> <MOL>WT<MOL> traj.zip, a compressed archive including trajectory files (.trr) for the <MOL>WT<MOL> <MOL>KRas-4B<MOL> runs, including 120 "*.trr"-formatted trajectories each corresponding to <STIME>40 ns<STIME> of MD simulation time, and (iii) a sample Python script to generate a free energy plot as shown in Fig. 2.
