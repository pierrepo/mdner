<MOL>POPC<MOL> <FFM>Ulmschneider<FFM> <FFM>OPLS<FFM> Verlet Group\nMD simulation trajectory and related files for fully hydrated <MOL>POPC<MOL> bilayer run with Verlet and Group schemes. The <FFM>Ulmschneider<FFM> force field for <MOL>POPC<MOL> was used with <SOFTNAME>Gromacs<SOFTNAME> <SOFTVERS>5.0.3<SOFTVERS> [1,2]. Conditions: T <TEMP>298.15<TEMP>, 128 <MOL>POPC<MOL> molecules, 5120 <MOL>tip3p<MOL> <MOL>waters<MOL>. <STIME>200ns<STIME> trajectory (preceded by <STIME>5ns<STIME> NPT equillibration). Starting structure was obtained from <SOFTNAME>CHARMM-GUI<SOFTNAME> [3]. This data is ran for the nmrlipids.blospot.fi project. More details from nmrlipids.blospot.fi and https://removed [1] J.P.
