zenodo	Large DPPC monolayer simulations with Charmm36+OPC @ 298 K (Part 2/2)	DPPC monolayers simulated at a varying area per lipid in the NVT ensemble. The Charmm36 lipid model [1] is employed together with the 4-point OPC water model [2]. Each system contains two monolayers with 256 lipids each. These monolayers are separated by a water slab, and surrounded by vacuum.  The number in the filename corresponds to the area per lipid in Ångströms. The starting structures were generated by setting up a POPC monolayer system with an area per lipid of 50 Å^2, followed by a simulation during which the monolayer area was expanded using PLUMED. Next, POPC was replaced by DPPC, and the systems were energy minimized. Systems with area smaller than 51 Å^2 were generated by compressing the DPPC monolayer system with PLUMED. All trajectories, 100–200 ns long (until convergence of surface tension), are simulated with Gromacs 5.0.x [3] using the default Charmm36 monolayer simulations parameters given in the mdp file. This file, together with the topology (.top) and index files (common for all systems) are available in Part 1 of this upload (see below). The topologies (.itp) for the lipids can be obtained from Charmm-GUI and for the OPC water model from https://bioinformatics.cs.vt.edu/~izadi/ .

Additionally, the systems contain 40 waters per lipid, and potassium counter ions for the anionic PS. This is an update to a previous upload in which the PS tails were reversed, so it was actually 'OPPS'. The starting configurations for the new files were generated by CHARMM-GUI. The new and corrected files are called ""PCPS_CACL_x, where x is the concentration of CaCl_2.  Final concentrations differ from the initial as ions adsorb to the membrane. Concentration calculated as #ion/#water = [ion]/[water], where [water]=55M. The lipid model by Maciejewski and Rog [1,2,3] was used. Topologies (.itp) were obtained from [3] and the OPPS chains were reversed (the fixed itp is included in the upload of the simulations of the same system with KCl: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1404040) to create POPS. TIP3P water was used, and the ions were modelled using default OPLS ion parameters.

zenodo	Simulations of POPC/POPS membranes with KCl	"Simulations of POPC/POPS (5:1, 144 lipids in total) membranes with 500, 1000, 2000, and 3000 mM of KCl. This is an update to a previous upload in which the PS tails were reversed, so it was actually 'OPPS'. Moreover, at 4000 mM of KCl the ions formed a crystal, so these data are omitted. The starting configurations were generated by CHARMM-GUI. The files of the old submission are called  ""PCPS-KClx"" with 'x' indicating the concentration of KCl, whereas the new and corrected files are called ""PCPS_KCL_x.  Simulations of the same membrane in the presence of only counterions as well as in the presence of different amounts of CaCl_2 are available in DOI:10.5281/zenodo.897467 The systems contain 40 waters per lipid, and additional potassium counter ions for the anionic PS. Final concentrations differ from the initial as ions adsorb to the membrane. Concentration calculated as #ion/#water = [ion]/[water], where [water]=55.5 M. The lipid model by Maciejewski and Rog [1,2,3] was used. Topologies (.itp) were obtained from [3] and the OPPS chains were reversed (the fixed itp is included in the upload) to create POPS. TIP3P water was used, and the ions were modelled using default OPLS ion parameters. All simulations are 300 ns long and the uploaded trajectories contain the last 200 ns. Simulation parameters common for all systems are given in the md.mdp file. Simulations were performed with Gromacs 2016.3 [4]. For each KCl concentration, the trajectory (.xtc), energy file (.edr), checkpoint file (.cpt), run input file (.tpr), index file (.ndx), topology file (.top), and the final structure (gro) are provided.  [1] Maciejewski et al., J.

zenodo	Coarse-grained simulations of cholesterol in symmetric lipid bilayers with restraints on cholesterol positions	Membranes consisting of 520 phospholipids varying levels of chain unsaturation together with 56 (10 mol%) cholesterol molecules were simulated at 298 K. The phospholipids had either 2 (DLiPC) or 4 (DAPC) double bonds in both of their chains. The Martini force field [1] was used and the membranes were generated using insane [2]. In the simulations, a flat-bottom potential was applied to the cholesterol molecules to either prevent them from partitioning to the membrane core, or from performing complete flip–flops. The simulations were run for 10 microsecond using the GROMACS simulation suite [3]. Simulation parameters are found in the common mdp file (note that the temperature varies between simulations). The upload contains simulation inputs and outputs that allows the replication, extension, or analysis of the simulation data: Topology files (top) and molecular definitions (itp) Index files (ndx) Run parameter files (mdp) A run input file (tpr) Trajectory file (xtc) written every 1 ns Energy file (edr) written every 100 ps Log file (log) Final structure file (gro) Continue point file (cpt) The files are named LLLL_CG_CHOLXX_RR_TTT.FFF, where LLLL is the type of phospholipid CG stands for coarse-grained (All atom data in a separate upload) CHOLXX stands for the cholesterol concentration (CHOL10 for 10 mol%) TTT is the temperature RR is the width of the flat-bottom potential FFF is the tile type (see above) Note that topologies/index files are the same regardless of temperature, and hence their file names do not have the TTT section. Moreover, md_RR.mdp is common for both lipid types yet activates a different flat-bottom potential based on RR.

zenodo	DPPC monolayer simulations with Charmm36+OPC @ 323 K	DPPC monolayers simulated at a varying area per lipid in the NVT ensemble. The Charmm36 lipid model [1] is employed together with the 4-point OPC water model [2]. Each system contains two monolayers with 64 lipids each with a change in simulation box size, except for the system titled 'large'. '200large' contains 128 lipids per monolayer, '400large' 64 lipids per monolayer and '1500large' 17 lipids per monolayer. These 'large' monolayers all have the same simulation box size. All monolayers are separated by a water slab, and surrounded by vacuum.  The number in the filename corresponds to the area per lipid in Ångströms. The starting structures were taken from [4], which also provides detailed information on system setup. The simulations in [3] used Slipids lipid model and TIP3P water model, which were replaced by Charmm36 lipid model and the OPC water model, followed by energy minimization and production runs. The 'large' monolayers were generated from the system 'md100' by replicating it four-fold (2x2) and subsequently removing lipids until the desired area per lipid was reached. All trajectories, 100 ns long, are simulated with Gromacs 5.0.x [4] using the parameters given in the mdp file.

The Charmm36 lipid model [1] is employed together with the 4-point OPC water model [2]. Each system contains two monolayers with 256 lipids each. These monolayers are separated by a water slab, and surrounded by vacuum.  The number in the filename corresponds to the area per lipid in Ångströms. The starting structures were generated by setting up a POPC monolayer system with an area per lipid of 50 Å^2, followed by a simulation during which the monolayer area was expanded using PLUMED. Next, POPC was replaced by DPPC, and the systems were energy minimized. Systems with area smaller than 51 Å^2 were generated by compressing the DPPC monolayer system with PLUMED. All trajectories, 100–200 ns long (until convergence of surface tension), are simulated with Gromacs 5.0.x [3] using the default Charmm36 monolayer simulations parameters given in the mdp file.

The DOPC leaflet consisted of 520 molecules, whereas the other leaflet consisted of either 520 DLiPC with 2 double bonds in both chains, 520 DAPC with 4 double bonds in both chains, or 468 DDPC with 6 double bonds in both chains. These numbers were adjusted to prevent membrane bending. Additionally, a symmetric DOPC membrane of the same size (520+520 lipids) was simulated. All systems also contained 112 molecules (10 mol%) of cholesterol. The Martini force field [1] was used and the membranes were generated using insane [2]. The simulations were run for 50 microseconds using the GROMACS simulation suite [3]. Simulation parameters are found in the common mdp file (note that the temperature varies between simulations).

zenodo	Data from: Antibiotic uptake across gram-negative outer membranes: better predictions towards better antibiotics	Crossing the gram-negative bacterial membrane poses a major barrier to antibiotic development, as many small molecules that can biochemically inhibit key bacterial processes are rendered microbiologically ineffective by their poor cellular uptake. The outer membrane is the major permeability barrier for many drug-like molecules, and the chemical properties that enable efficient uptake into mammalian cells fail to predict bacterial uptake. We have developed a computational method for accurate prospective prediction of outer-membrane uptake of drug-like molecules, which we combine with a new medium-throughput experimental assay of outer membrane vesicle swelling. Parallel molecular dynamics simulations of compound uptake through E. coli OmpF are used to successfully and quantitatively predict experimental permeabilities measured via either outer membrane swelling or via prior liposome swelling measurements. These simulations are analyzed using an inhomogeneous solubility-diffusion model to yield predictions of permeability. For most polar molecules we test, outer membrane permeability also correlates well with whole-cell uptake. The ability to accurately predict and measure outer-membrane uptake of a wide variety of small molecules will enable simpler determination of which molecular scaffolds and which derivatives are most promising prior to extensive chemical synthesis. It will also assist in formulating a more systematic understanding of the chemical determinants of outer-membrane permeability.	1632.0
zenodo	Simulations of GpA-based dimers of various lengths in DEPC, DOPC, and DLPC bilayers, part 1/2	Dimers of transmembrane (TM) peptides based on the Glycophorin A (GpA) dimer are simulated in different membrane environments. Three different homodimers with varying TM domain lengths and one heterodimer are considered. The homodimers are formed of either 17L (GRPNLKLLLGVLLGVLLTLLLLEYP) 23L (GRPNLKLLLLLLGVLLGVLLTLLLLLLLEYP) 29L (GRPNLKLLLLLLLLLGVLLGVLLTLLLLLLLLLLEYP) peptides, while the heterodimer consists of one 17L peptide and one 29L peptide. In the sequences, the bold letters denote the amino acids involved in the GpA dimerization motif. The dimers are simulated in DLPC (12:0 PC), DOPC (18:1 PC), or DEPC (22:1 PC) bilayers. Additionally, a polyleucine dimer is simulated in a DOPC bilayer. Bilayers consist of 400 lipids and they are adequately hydrated with 24000 water molecules and 134 mM NaCl. The simulations are 100 ns long with trajectories written every 100 ps. The files are named as XXX-YYYY.ZZZ, where XXX denotes to the peptide type ('het' for the heterodimer and 'polyl' for the polyleucine), YYYY denotes the bilayer type, and ZZZ denotes the file type. Files are in Gromacs format: .xtc for trajectories, .edr for energy data, .cpt for continue points, .ndx for index files, .top for topology files, and .tpr for run input files (Gromacs 5.1). The simulation parameter file (md.mdp) is common for all systems. The CHARMM36 force field is used; topologies are obtained from CHARMM-GUI, and those of the peptides are included in Gromacs format (.itp). More information on the systems is available in the publication, available here: (TO BE INCLUDED!) Note that the data for the heterodimer and for the polyleucine are in part 2/2, available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.573274	1801.0

zenodo	Atomistic simulations of the adenosine A2 receptor in membranes with varying levels of SDPE	An adenosine A2 receptor was simulated in membranes consisting of DSPC, cholesterol (20 mol%), and varying levels (0, 4, or 8 mol%) of SDPE with a polyunsaturated chain. Upon increasing SDPE concentration, the concentration of DSPC was correspondingly decreased. The initial structures for these simulations were obtained from the final structures of corresponding coarse-grained simulations, where an SDPE-rich corona formed around the receptor. After fine-graining, the systems were simulated using the CHARMM36 [1] force field for 200 ns using the GROMACS package [2]. These simulations were also repeated in the absence of protein. These systems were set up using the CHARMM-GUI web portal [3]. The corresponding files have the 'NOPROT' suffix, and the simulation parameter file is called md_noprot.mdp. For details on the fine-graining and the simulation protocol, please see the related paper at DOI: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007033. The files named PUFA_X.* correspond to simulations with X mol% of SDPE with the protein, whereas the files names PUFA_X_NOPROT.* are the corresponding files in the absence of the protein. For each concentration, a run input file (tpr) and the simulation outputs (xtc, edr, log, gro) are provided. Moreover, the simulations can be extended using the provided cpt files. Moreover, the files required to generate the run input file are also provided. For each system, a topology file (top) and an index file (ndx) are provided. The CHARMM36 force field and the molecule definitions (itp) referenced by the topology are also provided. The used simulation parameters are provided in the md.mdp file. For the fine-graining of SDPE, the mapping file is also provided (sdpe.charmm36.map). [1] DOI: 10.1021/jp101759q [2] DOI: 10.1016/j.softx.2015.06.001 [3] DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00935	1906.0

zenodo	Simulations of GpA-based dimers of various lengths in DEPC, DOPC, and DLPC bilayers, part 2/2	Dimers of transmembrane (TM) peptides based on the Glycophorin A (GpA) dimer are simulated in different membrane environments. Three different homodimers with varying TM domain lengths and one heterodimer are considered. The homodimers are formed of either 17L (GRPNLKLLLGVLLGVLLTLLLLEYP) 23L (GRPNLKLLLLLLGVLLGVLLTLLLLLLLEYP) 29L (GRPNLKLLLLLLLLLGVLLGVLLTLLLLLLLLLLEYP) peptides, while the heterodimer consists of one 17L peptide and one 29L peptide. In the sequences, the bold letters denote the amino acids involved in the GpA dimerization motif. The dimers are simulated in DLPC (12:0 PC), DOPC (18:1 PC), or DEPC (22:1 PC) bilayers. Additionally, a polyleucine dimer is simulated in a DOPC bilayer. Bilayers consist of 400 lipids and they are adequately hydrated with 24000 water molecules and 134 mM NaCl. The simulations are 100 ns long with trajectories written every 100 ps. The files are named as XXX-YYYY.ZZZ, where XXX denotes to the peptide type ('het' for the heterodimer and 'polyl' for the polyleucine), YYYY denotes the bilayer type, and ZZZ denotes the file type. Files are in Gromacs format: .xtc for trajectories, .edr for energy data, .cpt for continue points, .ndx for index files, .top for topology files, and .tpr for run input files (Gromacs 5.1). The simulation parameter file (md.mdp) is common for all systems. The CHARMM36 force field is used; topologies are obtained from CHARMM-GUI, and those of the peptides are included in Gromacs format (.itp).

zenodo	Coarse-grained simulations of protein partitioning in membranes with varying levels of SDPE	The free energies of transfer between liquid ordered (Lo) and liquid disordered (Ld) domains was calculated for three proteins (Adenosine A2 receptor, A2AR; dopamine D2 receptor, D2R; and glucose transporter (GLUT)) using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations together with free energy perturbation. Each of these proteins was embedded in a Lo membrane consisting of DSPC, cholesterol, and varying levels (0–16 mol%) of SDPE. First, the lipids were allowed to reorganize during a 10 microsecond simulations. Then, for each protein and for each SDPE concentration, the DSPC lipids were mutated into DOPC ones and the free energy of this change was calculated. This process was repeated in the absence of the proteins for each SDPE concentration. By substracting the corresponding values for the protein-containing and protein-free cases, the free energy of transfer between Lo and Ld domains was calculated for each of the proteins as a function of SDPE concentration. All simulations were performed using the Martini force field [1] and the GROMACS simulation package [2]. For more details of the setup and the simulations, please see the related paper at DOI: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007033. The original equilibration simulations (10 microseconds in the presence of the protein and SDPE and shorter in the absence of either SDPE or the protein). The run input files for these simulations are provided as X_PUFAY_EQ.tpr and the trajectories as X_PUFAY_EQ.xtc, where X stands for the protein (or says 'NOPROT' for the case without protein) and Y for the SDPE concentration. The run input files for the free energy of transfer simulations are provided as the tar files; one tar for each protein and one for the protein-free case. Each of these tars contains a folder for each used SDPE concentration, including the more realistic membrane compositions (with a suffix 'REAL'). For each SDPE concentration, the run input files (tpr) and the simulation input parameter files (mdp) for each window in the free energy perturbation are provided. Here, the windows are numbered from 0 to 26, where 0 corresponds to DSPC and 26 to DOPC. Also, for each SDPE concentration, common topology (top), index (ndx) and start configuration (gro) are provided. The molecule definitions (itp) are provided in the TOP.tar archive.

The Charmm36 lipid model [1] is employed together with the 4-point OPC water model [2]. Each system contains two monolayers with 256 lipids each. These monolayers are separated by a water slab, and surrounded by vacuum.  The number in the filename corresponds to the area per lipid in Ångströms. The starting structures were generated by setting up a POPC monolayer system with an area per lipid of 50 Å^2, followed by a simulation during which the monolayer area was expanded using PLUMED. Next, POPC was replaced by DPPC, and the systems were energy minimized. Systems with area smaller than 51 Å^2 were generated by compressing the DPPC monolayer system with PLUMED.

zenodo	Simulations of membrane proteins in a mixture of lipids with varying levels of chain unsaturation	Four structurally distinct membrane proteins were simulated in a mixture of phospholipids. The membranes contained one copy of one of the protein types with equimolar concentrations of DPPC, DOPC, DLiPC, SDPC, and cholesterol. The CHARMM36 force field [1] was employed, and the systems were built using the CHARMM-GUI web portal [2]. The 4-microsecond long simulations were performed using GROMACS [3]. Further details on the setup of the systems as well as on the simulation protocol can be found in the related paper at DOI: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007033. The files are named based on the PDB codes of the proteins (1AFO, 2M0B, 3EML, and 3EMN). For each system, the original simulation run input file (tpr) and the corresponding outputs (xtc, edr) are provided. Additionally, the simulations can be extended using the continue point (cpt) file. For each system the files required to generate the run input file are also provided: the topology file (top), index file (ndx), and a common run parameter file (mdp). The CHARMM36 force field can be downloaded from http://mackerell.umaryland.edu/charmm_ff.shtml Notably, the protein definition files (itp) were re-generated. After performing these simulations, the atom ordering of cholesterol in the CHARMM36 force field was changed. The provided gro files, as well as the lipid definition files (itp) correspond to this new atom order. While they can be used to generate a run input file, yet this run input file will not be identical to the one provided. Therefore: 1) for analysis, the provided xtc+tpr files are fine; 2) for extending the simulation, the tpr+cpt files are fine; 3) for new simulations, the tpr file can be generated based on the provided files, yet it cannot be used together with the provided xtc file.

zenodo	DPPC monolayer simulations with Slipids+OPC	"DPPC monolayers simulated at a varying area per lipid in the NVT ensemble. The Slipids lipid model [1] is employed together with the 4-point OPC water model [2]. Each system contains two monolayers with 64 lipids each with a change in simulation box size, except for the system titled 'large'. '200large' contains 128 lipids per monolayer, '400large' 64 lipids per monolayer and '1500large' 17 lipids per monolayer. These 'large' monolayers all have the same simulation box size. All monolayers are separated by a water slab, and surrounded by vacuum.  The number in the filename corresponds to the area per lipid in Ångströms. The starting structures were taken from [3], which also provides detailed information on system setup. The simulations in [3] used TIP3P water, which was replaced by OPC, followed by energy minimization and production runs. The 'large' monolayers were generated from the system 'md100' by replicating it four-fold (2x2) and subsequently removing lipids until the desired area per lipid was reached. All trajectories, 100 ns long, are simulated with Gromacs 4.6.x [4] using the parameters given in the mdp file.

It is possible that these are due to a slight bug in the GROMACS-LS (http://mdstress.org) code, because: 1) The fluctuations do not show converge, when more data is added, see the attached plot ‘effect_of_sampling_rate.pdf’. 2) The fluctuations (but no other features of the stress profiles) visibly depend on the chosen frame of reference, see ‘effect_of_centering_schemes.pdf’. 3) The stress profiles calculated along the coordinates that lay in the membrane plane (x and y), are not constant in CCFD, see ‘profiles_along_x_and_y.pdf’.   To assist debugging the code, this repository contains: 5to95_0to100_0.trr --- 1st 33.3% of a 5 us trajectory with snapshots every 100 ps 5to95_0to100_0.trr --- 2nd 33.3% of a 5 us trajectory with snapshots every 100 ps 5to95_0to100_0.trr --- 3rd 33.3% of a 5 us trajectory with snapshots every 100 ps 5to95_0to100.tpr --- tpr used for production (Gromacs 5.1.1) 5to95_0to100_rerun.tpr --- tpr used for stress analysis and centering 5to95_0to100.gro --- gro file after 15 us (10 us relaxation, 5 us production) index.ndx --- index file used in production 5to95_0to100.ndx --- index file used in analysis system.top --- topology file martini_v2.0_ions.itp --- martini FF file (system.top expects this to be in folder toppar/) martini_v2.0_lipids_all_201506.itp --- martini FF file (system.top expects this to be in folder toppar/) martini_v2.2.itp --- martini FF file (system.top expects this to be in folder toppar/) martini_straight_GM1_saveVels.mdp --- run input file used for production (Gromacs 5.1.1) martini_straight_GM1_rerunForP.mdp --- run input file used for analysis and centering effect_of_sampling_rate.pdf --- plot of results showing that fluctuations in CCFD do not appear to converge when data is added profiles_along_x_and_y.pdf --- plot of results showing that in CCFD pressure profiles along the membrane directions are not constant effect_of_centering_schemes.pdf --- plot of results showing that choice of center of mass (here three possibilities are shown: CoM of POPC GL1 beads, CoM of POPCs, and CoM of all lipids) visibly affects CCFD fluctuations, but not other features of the stress profile effect_of_centering_schemes_2.pdf --- plot of results (similar to 'effect_of_centering_schemes.pdf', but the center of the bilayer is at 3.7 nm instead at 0.0 / 7.4 nm) individual_components.pdf --- plot of results showing that the fluctuations in CCFD arise from dihedrals CCFD_gridsize.pdf --- plot of results showing that decreasing gridsize has no clear effect on the CCFD fluctuations	2825.0

zenodo	Large POPC monolayer simulations with Charmm36+OPC @ 298 K (Part 2/2)	POPC monolayers simulated at a varying area per lipid in the NVT ensemble. The Charmm36 lipid model [1] is employed together with the 4-point OPC water model [2]. Each system contains two monolayers with 256 lipids each. These monolayers are separated by a water slab, and surrounded by vacuum.  The number in the filename corresponds to the area per lipid in Ångströms. The starting structures were generated by setting up a system with an area per lipid of 50 Å^2, followed by a simulation during which the monolayer area was expanded using PLUMED.  All trajectories, 100 ns long, are simulated with Gromacs 5.0.x [3] using the default Charmm36 monolayer simulations parameters given in the mdp file. This mdp file, together with the topology (.top) and index files (common for all simulations) can be downloaded from Part 1 of this upload (see below). The topologies (.itp) for the lipids can be obtained from Charmm-GUI and for the OPC water model from https://bioinformatics.cs.vt.edu/~izadi/ . Part 1 of this upload is available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.322830 The data are discussed in the related publication: Matti Javanainen, Antti Lamberg, Lukasz Cwiklik, Ilpo Vattulainen, and O.

zenodo	Coarse-grained simulations of lipid membranes with various concentrations of embedded proteins	Membranes with a polydisperse set of proteins with lipid/protein ratios of 50 (lp50), 75 (lp75), 100 (lp100), 200 (lp200), and 400 (lp400) are simulated for 100 µs. The protein–protein interactions are scaled down to prevent excessive aggregation.  For all simulated lipid/protein ratio, a trajectory (.xtc) file is stored every 10 ns. Note that water beads and ions have been removed for a smaller file size. All beads, including solvent ones, are present in initial and final structures (.gro). Energy terms are stored every 1 ns (.edr). Simulation run input files (.tpr) and checkpoint files (.cpt) enable the rerunning or continuation of the simulations. Topology (.top) and index (.ndx) files for each system are also provided. The topology files for scaled protein–protein interactions work as follows: The bead types of the proteins in their topology files (.itp) are changed to those with a 'p', for example P4–>P4p. The interactions between normal beads are listed in martini_v2.2_standard.itp, while the interactions among 'p' beads as well as the cross terms between 'p' beads and normal beads are given in martini_v2.2_scaled_80.itp. The force constant of the elastic network was increased to enable an integration time step of 20 fs. The lipid head groups are gently restrained in the direction normal to the membrane to prevent excessive fluctuations and they hence simulate the presence of an actin cytoskeleton. The simulation parameters, common for all systems, are listed in the file md.mdp.  All files are compatible with Gromacs 5.0. The results extracted from these simulations are presented in the paper M. Javanainen, H. Martinez-Seara, R. Metzler, and I. Vattulainen; Diffusion of Integral Membrane Proteins in Protein-Rich Membranes. J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 2017, 8 (17), pp 4308–4313, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpclett.7b01758 The Martini topologies are obtained form http://cgmartini.nl	1996.0
zenodo	Data from: A multiscale biophysical model for the recruitment of actin nucleating proteins at the membrane interface	The dynamics and organization of the actin cytoskeleton are crucial to many cellular events such as motility, polarization, cell shaping, and cell division. The intracellular and extracellular signaling associated with this cytoskeletal network is communicated through cell membranes. Hence the organization of membrane macromolecules and actin filament assembly are highly interdependent. Although the actin-membrane linkage is known to happen through many routes, the major class of interactions is through the direct interaction of actin-binding proteins with the lipid class containing poly-phosphatidylinositols (PPIs). Among the PPIs, phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) acts as a significant factor controlling actin polymerization in the proximity of the membrane by binding to actin-associated proteins. The molecular interactions between these actin-binding proteins and the membrane lipids remain elusive. Here, using molecular modeling, analytical theory, and experimental methods, we investigate the binding of three different actin-binding proteins, mDia2, NWASP, and gelsolin, to membranes containing PI(4,5)P2 lipids. We perform molecular dynamics simulations on the protein-bilayer system and analyze the membrane binding in the form of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges at various PI(4,5)P2 and cholesterol concentrations. Our experimental study with PI(4,5)P2-containing large unilamellar vesicles mimics the computational experiments. Using the multivalencies of the proteins obtained in molecular simulations and the cooperative binding mechanisms of the proteins, we also propose a multivalent binding model that predicts the actin filament distributions at various PI(4,5)P2 and protein concentrations.	1849.0

zenodo	Interaction of the inhibitory peptides ShK and HmK with the voltage-gated potassium channel KV1.3: Role of conformational dynamics	ABSTRACT: Peptide toxins that adopt the ShK fold can inhibit the voltage-gated potassium channel KV1.3 with IC50 values in the pM range, and are therefore potential leads for drugs targeting autoimmune and neuroinflammatory diseases. NMR relaxation measurements and pressure-dependent NMR have shown that, despite being cross-linked by disulfide bonds, ShK itself is flexible in solution. This flexibility affects the local structure around the pharmacophore for KV1.3 channel blockade and, in particular, the relative orientation of the key Lys and Tyr side chains (Lys22 and Tyr23 in ShK), and has implications for the design of KV1.3 inhibitors. In this study, we have performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on ShK and a close homolog, HmK, in order to probe the conformational space occupied by the Lys and Tyr residues, and docked the different conformations with a recently determined cryo-EM structure of the KV1.3 channel. Although ShK and HmK have 60% sequence identity, their dynamic behaviors are quite different, with ShK sampling a broad range of conformations over the course of a 5 μs MD simulation, while HmK is relatively rigid. We also investigated the importance of conformational dynamics, in particular the distance between the side chains of the key dyad Lys22 and Tyr23, for binding to KV1.3. Although these peptides have quite different dynamics, the dyad in both adopts a similar configuration upon binding, revealing a conformational selection upon binding to KV1.3 in the case of ShK. Intriguingly, the more flexible peptide, ShK, binds with nearly 300-fold higher affinity than HmK.	1747.0

zenodo	All-atom Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Meiosis 1-associated protein (M1AP) to Investagate the Impact of Known Missense Mutations Associated with Male Infertility through Non-obstructive Azoospermia	"Protein structure of meiosis 1-associated protein (M1AP) was modelled by using GalaxyWeb (from Seok Lab). We used this model to investigate the impact of variants (i.e., S50P, R266Q, P389L, G317R, and L430P) in M1AP which were recently associated with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). NOA is a male infertility-related condition causing absence of sperm in the seminal fluid due to meiosis failure. We aimed to elucidate the pathogenicity mechanisms of these five missense NOA-related mutations on M1AP by performing molecular modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This dataset includes the results of 1000 ns MD simulations (two repeats, each 500 ns) for each of the mutant and wild-type systems. Systems were prepared in Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD 1.9.3) by placing them in a TIP3P water box with approximately 20 Å thickness from the protein surface and neutralizing the system charge with 0.15 M KCl. Of note, only protein parts were kept for the submission to reduce the size of files. Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics (NAMD 2.13-CUDA) was used to perform MD simulations with CHARMM36m force field. For pressure and temperature controls, Nosé-Hoover Langevin barostat and Langevin thermostat were used. ShakeH algorithm of NAMD was applied for water molecule constraints. 12 Å cut-off distance was used for van der Waals interactions. Switching function starts at 10 Å and reaches zero at 14 Å. Integration time-step was 2 fs. To compute the long-range Coulomb interactions, the particle-mash Ewald method was used. NPT ensemble was applied for whole simulations. Two step minimization & equilibration procedure was performed: (1) 5,000-step minimization and 1 ns equilibrium with constraints on the protein; (2) 5,000-step minimization and 1 ns equilibrium without the constraints on the protein. All related configuration files for wild-type system were also included to the dataset. Production simulations were run twice along 500 ns by using different random seeds to assign the velocities from Boltzmann distribution (total simulation time for each system was 1000 ns, which are given as 500 ns repeat 1, and 500 ns repeat 2). The production simulations were supplied in the dataset. ""out"" and ""log"" files were used for energy analysis. For all analysis scripts, see https://github.com/ugerlevik/M1AP_analysis."	2535.0

zenodo	Data for: Excitatory and inhibitory D-serine binding to the NMDA receptor	N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) uniquely require binding of two different neurotransmitter agonists for synaptic transmission. D-serine and glycine bind to one subunit, GluN1, while glutamate binds to the other, GluN2. These agonists bind to the receptor's bi-lobed ligand-binding domains (LBDs), which close around the agonist during receptor activation. To better understand the unexplored mechanisms by which D-serine contributes to receptor activation, we performed multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of the GluN1/GluN2A LBD dimer with free D-serine and glutamate agonists. Surprisingly, we observed D-serine binding to both GluN1 and GluN2A LBDs, suggesting that D-serine competes with glutamate for binding to GluN2A. This mechanism is confirmed by our electrophysiology experiments, which show that D-serine is indeed inhibitory at high concentrations. Although free energy calculations indicate that D-serine stabilizes the closed GluN2A LBD, its inhibitory behavior suggests that it either does not remain bound long enough or does not generate sufficient force for ion channel gating. We developed a workflow using pathway similarity analysis to identify groups of residues working together to promote binding. These conformation-dependent pathways were not significantly impacted by the presence of N-linked glycans, which act primarily by interacting with the LBD bottom lobe to stabilize the closed LBD.	1511.0
zenodo	Data from: Molecular dynamic simulations reveal the structural determinants of fatty acid binding to oxy-myoglobin	"The mechanism(s) by which fatty acids are sequestered and transported in muscle have not been fully elucidated. A potential key player in this process is the protein myoglobin (Mb). Indeed, there is a catalogue of empirical evidence supporting direct interaction of globins with fatty acid metabolites; however, the binding pocket and regulation of the interaction remains to be established. In this study, we employed a computational strategy to elucidate the structural determinants of fatty acids (palmitic & oleic acid) binding to Mb. Sequence analysis and docking simulations with a horse (Equus caballus) structural Mb reference reveals a fatty acid-binding site in the hydrophobic cleft near the heme region in Mb. Both palmitic acid and oleic acid attain a ""U"" shaped structure similar to their conformation in pockets of other fatty acid-binding proteins. Specifically, we found that the carboxyl head group of palmitic acid coordinates with the amino group of Lys45, whereas the carboxyl group of oleic acid coordinates with both the amino groups of Lys45 and Lys63. The alkyl tails of both fatty acids are supported by surrounding hydrophobic residues Leu29, Leu32, Phe33, Phe43, Phe46, Val67, Val68 and Ile107. In the saturated palmitic acid, the hydrophobic tail moves freely and occasionally penetrates deeper inside the hydrophobic cleft, making additional contacts with Val28, Leu69, Leu72 and Ile111. Our simulations reveal a dynamic and stable binding pocket in which the oxygen molecule and heme group in Mb are required for additional hydrophobic interactions. Taken together, these findings support a mechanism in which Mb acts as a muscle transporter for fatty acid when it is in the oxygenated state and releases fatty acid when Mb converts to deoxygenated state."	1900.0

zenodo	Molecular dynamics derived side chain order parameters for Asp, Glu, Asn, and Gln residues in ribonucleases H, and molecular dynamics trajectories for E. coli ribonuclease H	This dataset contains tab-delimited text files reporting the complete calculated S2 side chain order parameters for carboxyl- and carbonyl-containing residues (Asp, Glu, Asn, Gln) in all RNase H homologs studied, as well as complete simulation trajectory data for the E. coli apo, site A, and site B simulations described in the text. We hope that easy access to the complete trajectory data for the experimentally best-characterized homolog will facilitate future comparison between simulation and experiments. order_parameters_magnesium.dat contains the calculated S2 side chain order parameters for carboxyl- and carbonyl-containing residues in each of the three E. coli trajectories supplied in this dataset. These data are sufficient to reproduce Figure 6. 2RN2.apo.pdb, 2RN2.MG.siteA.pdb, and 2RN2.MG.siteB.pdb define the equilibrated structure from which the E. coli apo, site A, and site B trajectories were initiated. All protein atoms, including hydrogens, are included, as well as Mg ions. Explicit waters and chloride counterions have been removed. 2RN2.apo.dcd, 2RN2.MG.siteA.dcd, and 2RN2.MG.siteB.dcd contain 100ns trajectories initiated from the starting structures in the corresponding pdb files. Frames were written every 4.5ps. Trajectories have been aligned to the initial structure of the apo trajectory to facilitate visualization. The remaining *.S2.CO.dat files contain the calculated S2 side chain order parameters for all apo RNases H simulated in this study. Each file is named for the PDB ID of its corresponding structure (see Table 1). These data are sufficient to reproduce Figure 8 (which reports on only the conserved active-site residues).	1846.0

zenodo	In silico prediction of ARB resistance: A first step in creating personalized ARB therapy	AT1R Model preparation The crystal structure of human AT1R bound to olmesartan (PDB: 4ZUD) was downloaded from the RCSB Protein Data Bank. 4ZUD contains apocytochrome b562RIL fused to the amino terminus, and many of the flexible regions, as well as helix 8, are not resolved. In order to generate an appropriate starting structure, olmesartan and the apocytochrome b562RIL fusion were removed from 4ZUD, and the missing regions were added to the protein with MOE software (Chemical Computing Group ULC, Montreal, Canada). Specifically, the N-Terminus (residues 1 to 25), intracellular loop 2 (residues 134 to 140), extracellular loop 2 (residues 186 to 188), intracellular loop 3 (residues 223 to 234), and helix 8 (residues 305 to 316) were added to the AT1R in accordance to the human AT1R sequence and PDB:4YAY. The remaining carboxyl-tail of the AT1R (residues 317 to 359) was not modeled. The AT1R model then underwent an energy minimization within MOE using the Amber10:Extended Huckel Theory (EHT) force field. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and analysis The MOE minimized AT1R was loaded into CHARMM-GUI. An 80 Å by 80 Å lipid bi-layer composed of 13% cholesterol and 87% Phosphatidylcholine (POPC) was generated around the receptor. Water was packed 17.5 Å above and below the lipid bi-layer, and 150 mM Na+ and Cl- ions were added to the system via Monte-Carlo ion placing. The all-atom CHARMM C36 force field for proteins and ions, and the CHARMM TIP3P force field for water were selected. A hard non-bonded cutoff of 8.0 angstroms was utilized. All molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the PMEMD module of the AMBER16 package with support for MPI multi-process control and GPU acceleration code.  Orthorhombic periodic boundary conditions with a constant pressure of 1 atm was set via the NPT ensemble and temperature was set to 310.15°K (37°C) using Langevin dynamics. The SHAKE algorithm was used to constrain bonds containing hydrogens. The dynamics were propagated using Langevin dynamics with Langevin damping coefficient of 1 ps-1 and a time step of 2 fs. Before the production run, the AT1R model was minimized for 5000 steps using the steepest descent method and then equilibrated for 600 ps. The protein coordinates were saved in 10 ps intervals. The production run lasted 150 ns, at which point all three replicas were stable for at least the last 20 ns.	2484.0

zenodo	Simulation Data for Design of Peptides that Fold and Self-Assemble on Graphite	"This data set for the manuscript entitled ""Design of Peptides that Fold and Self-Assemble on Graphite"" includes all files needed to run and analyze the simulations described in the this manuscript in the molecular dynamics software NAMD, as well as the output of the simulations. The files are organized into directories corresponding to the figures of the main text and supporting information. They include molecular model structure files (NAMD psf or Amber prmtop format), force field parameter files (in CHARMM format), initial atomic coordinates (pdb format), NAMD configuration files, Colvars configuration files, NAMD log files, and NAMD output including restart files (in binary NAMD format) and trajectories in dcd format (downsampled to 10 ns per frame). Analysis is controlled by shell scripts (Bash-compatible) that call VMD Tcl scripts or python scripts. These scripts and their output are also included. Version: 2.0 Changes versus version 1.0 are the addition of the free energy of folding, adsorption, and pairing calculations (Sim_Figure-7) and shifting of the figure numbers to accommodate this addition. Conventions Used in These Files =============================== Structure Files ---------------- - graph_*.psf or sol_*.psf (original NAMD (XPLOR?) format psf file including atom details (type, charge, mass), as well as definitions of bonds, angles, dihedrals, and impropers for each dipeptide.) - graph_*.pdb or sol_*.pdb (initial coordinates before equilibration) - repart_*.psf (same as the above psf files, but the masses of non-water hydrogen atoms have been repartitioned by VMD script repartitionMass.tcl) - freeTop_*.pdb (same as the above pdb files, but the carbons of the lower graphene layer have been placed at a single z value and marked for restraints in NAMD) - amber_*.prmtop (combined topology and parameter files for Amber force field simulations) - repart_amber_*.prmtop (same as the above prmtop files, but the masses of non-water hydrogen atoms have been repartitioned by ParmEd) Force Field Parameters ---------------------- CHARMM format parameter files: - par_all36m_prot.prm (CHARMM36m FF for proteins) - par_all36_cgenff_no_nbfix.prm (CGenFF v4.4 for graphene) The NBFIX parameters are commented out since they are only needed for aromatic halogens and we use only the CG2R61 type for graphene. - toppar_water_ions_prot_cgenff.str (CHARMM water and ions with NBFIX parameters needed for protein and CGenFF included and others commented out) Template NAMD Configuration Files --------------------------------- These contain the most commonly used simulation parameters. They are called by the other NAMD configuration files (which are in the namd/ subdirectory): - template_min.namd (minimization) - template_eq.namd (NPT equilibration with lower graphene fixed) - template_abf.namd (for adaptive biasing force) Minimization ------------- - namd/min_*.0.namd Equilibration ------------- - namd/eq_*.0.namd Adaptive biasing force calculations ----------------------------------- - namd/eabfZRest7_graph_chp1404.0.namd - namd/eabfZRest7_graph_chp1404.1.namd (continuation of eabfZRest7_graph_chp1404.0.namd) Log Files --------- For each NAMD configuration file given in the last two sections, there is a log file with the same prefix, which gives the text output of NAMD. For instance, the output of namd/eabfZRest7_graph_chp1404.0.namd is eabfZRest7_graph_chp1404.0.log. Simulation Output ----------------- The simulation output files (which match the names of the NAMD configuration files) are in the output/ directory. Files with the extensions .coor, .vel, and .xsc are coordinates in NAMD binary format, velocities in NAMD binary format, and extended system information (including cell size) in text format. Files with the extension .dcd give the trajectory of the atomic coorinates over time (and also include system cell information). Due to storage limitations, large DCD files have been omitted or replaced with new DCD files having the prefix stride50_ including only every 50 frames. The time between frames in these files is 50 * 50000 steps/frame * 4 fs/step = 10 ns. The system cell trajectory is also included for the NPT runs are output/eq_*.xst. Scripts ------- Files with the .sh extension can be found throughout. These usually provide the highest level control for submission of simulations and analysis. Look to these as a guide to what is happening. If there are scripts with step1_*.sh and step2_*.sh, they are intended to be run in order, with step1_*.sh first.

Sim_Figure-7: Free energy calculations for folding, adsorption, and pairing for the peptide CHP1404 (sequence: cyc(GTGSGTG-GPGG-GCGTGTG-SGPG)). For folding, we calculate the PMF as function of RMSD by replica-exchange umbrella sampling (in the subdirectory Folding_CHP1404_Graphene/). We make the same calculation in solution, which required 3 seperate replica-exchange umbrella sampling calculations (in the subdirectory Folding_CHP1404_Solution/). Both PMF of RMSD calculations for the scrambled peptide are in Folding_scram1404/. For adsorption, calculation of the PMF for the orientational restraints and the calculation of the PMF along z (the distance between the graphene sheet and the center of mass of the peptide) are in Adsorption_CHP1404/ and Adsorption_scram1404/. The actual calculation of the free energy is done by a shell script (""doRestraintEnergyError.sh"") in the 1_free_energy/ subsubdirectory. Processing of the PMFs must be done first in the 0_pmf/ subsubdirectory. Finally, files for free energy calculations of pair formation for CHP1404 are found in the Pair/ subdirectory.

zenodo	Molecular dynamics simulations of intrinsically disordered proteins p53TAD and Pup	Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are highly dynamic systems that play an important role in cell signaling processes and their misfunction often causes human disease. Proper understanding of IDP function not only requires the realistic characterization of their three-dimensional conformational ensembles at atomic-level resolution but also of the time scales of interconversion between their conformational substates. Large sets of experimental data are often used in combination with molecular modeling to restrain or bias models to improve agreement with experiment. It is shown here for the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53 (p53TAD) and Pup how the latest advancements in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations methodology produces native conformational ensembles by combining replica exchange with series of microsecond MD simulations. They closely reproduce experimental data at the global conformational ensemble level, in terms of the distribution properties of the radius of gyration tensor, and at the local level, in terms of NMR properties including 15N spin relaxation, without the need for reweighting. The IDP ensembles were analyzed by graph theory to identify dominant inter-residue contact clusters and characteristic amino-acid contact propensities. These findings indicate that modern MD force fields with residue-specific backbone potentials can produce highly realistic IDP ensembles sampling a hierarchy of nano- and picosecond time scales providing new insights into their biological function.	1611.0
zenodo	All-atom accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) simulations of Filamin-A (FLNa) actin-binding Domain, immunoglobulin-like Domains 3, 4, 5, 21 and 24 to investagate the impact of known missense mutations associated with periventricular nodular heterotopia in the liveborn males	Data includes all of the wild-type and mutant trajectories of accelerated all-atom molecular dynamics (aMD) simulations of Filamin-A (FLNa, the product of FLNA gene located on chromosome X). Wild-type proteins are from the PDB structures with IDs: 4M9P, 3HOP, 3CNK. The mutations, including R484Q that we discovered in a Turkish family, were formerly found in the liveborn males with FLNA-associated periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH), who survived with the only copy of mutated FLNA. To understand how these mutations lead to the PNH and simultaneously allow their survival, we performed these MD simulations for the wild-type and mutant systems. Systems were prepared in Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD 1.9.3) by placing them in a TIP3P water box with approximately 20 Å thickness from the protein surface and neutralizing the system by adding counter ions in the form of NaCl. Of note, only protein parts were kept for the submission to reduce the size of files. Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics (NAMD 2.13-CUDA) was used to perform MD simulations with CHARMM36m force field. For pressure and temperature controls, Nosé-Hoover Langevin barostat and Langevin thermostat were used. ShakeH algorithm of NAMD was applied for water molecule constraints. 12 Å cut-off distance was used for van der Waals interactions. Switching function starts at 10 Å and reaches zero at 14 Å. Integration time-step was 2 fs. To compute the long-range Coulomb interactions, the particle-mash Ewald method was used. After a 10000-step minimization with conjugate gradient algorithm and an equilibration for 1 ns at 298 K under NVT ensemble, production simulations were run along 100 ns. Only the production simulations were supplied in this dataset. Further details are available in the regarding configuration files. Resulting analysis files and scripts are included with the carbon alpha-containing dcd files of the simulations. This dataset is not used directly for any study, but they are preliminary results for the usage of aMD to understand rare disease mechanisms.

zenodo	Probing the Electrical Double Layer by Operando X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy through a Graphene-Carbon Nanotube Composite Window	Supporting information for Molecular Dynamics NAMD 2.0 simulations of BPY1,4-TFSI-Li ionic liquid mixture encased in cuboid graphene box for graphene window double layer calculations presented in submitted manuscript to Eco Mat journal. The files contain new developed parameters for BPY1,3-TFSI force field based on Gaussian09 DFT calculations and relevant PDB and PSF and configuration files for NAMD runs at 0, 1 and 3Volt. Abstract:  The electrical double layer is known to spontaneously form at the electrode-electrolyte interface, impacting many important chemical and physical processes as well as applications including electrocatalysis, electroorganic synthesis, nanomaterial preparation, energy storage, and even emulsion stabilization. However, it has been challenging to study this fundamental phenomenon at the molecular level because the electrical double layer is deeply “buried” by the bulk electrolyte solution. Here, we report a quantitative probing of the electrical double layer of ionic liquids from the solid side of a photoelectron-transparent graphene-carbon nanotube hybrid membrane electrode using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The membrane window is ultrathin (~1.5 nm), large (~1 cm2), and robust, enabling a tight seal of the electrolyte and quantitative measurement with excellent photoelectron signals. By operandomonitoring the population changes of cations and anions in response to the applied electrical potentials, we experimentally resolve the chemical structure and dynamics of the electrical double layer, which corroborate results from molecular dynamics simulations.	1743.0
zenodo	Molecular dynamics trajectories for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with 7 HIV inhibitors	Raw trajectory data (GROMACS format) of all atom molecular dynamics simulation of COVID-19 related SARS-CoV-2 dimeric main protease (based on PDB 6LU7) with 7 kinds of HIV inhibitors (darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir) were calculated on massively parallel supercomputer HOKUSAI Big Waterfall at RIKEN ISC, and a special-purpose computer, MDGRAPE-4A, at RIKEN BDR, JAPAN. For each ligand, 200ns length 28 trajectories were calculated. Some of these trajectories were calculated further longer. We can observe formation of encounter complex and investigate potential binding sites on the surface of the dimeric protease. We hope that these raw data are valuable for further drug repurposing/development research targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. We will submit analysis of these data to refereed journal. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed under NVT at 310K, with the time step 2.5fs. The starting structure was prepared based on PDB 6LU7, with amber14sb force field in about 10nm cubic box with periodic boundary conditions.

zenodo	Fourier projection algorithm for calculating phonon dispersion relations of crystals	We propose a Fourier projection algorithm and demonstrate its superiority for calculation of the phonon dispersion relations of 2D and 3D crystals based on the atomic coordinate trajectories from supercell molecular dynamics/first-principle molecular dynamics simulations. The lattice vibration states are described in a six-dimensional phase space composed of lattice and wave vectors. Phonon dispersion information in the first Brillouin zone sampled with a k-mesh grid of N×N×N is generated by Fourier projection of the lattice vibration frequencies in the supercell by N×N×N primitive cells, the dispersion relations along high-symmetry paths are retrieved therefrom. Our algorithm is physically intuitive, computationally convenient, and universally applicable. As examples of application, the successful dispersion relation calculations of 2D graphene, 3D BCC-Fe and FCC-Cu are presented. This algorithm shows the correspondence between real and reciprocal lattices, that is, the spatial information in the states of the lattice vibration were preserved. The high-symmetry paths of the first Brillouin zone in the reciprocal lattice primitive cells of the hexagonal, BCC, and FCC lattice were also given in detail. In combination with first-principles molecular dynamics, as long as the interatomic force is accurately known, reliable and accurate dispersion relation can be achieved by this Fourier projection algorithm.	1511.0
zenodo	A molecular dynamics study of adenylyl cyclase: the impact of ATP and G-protein binding	Adenylyl cyclases (ACs) catalyze the biosynthesis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and play an important role in many signal transduction pathways. The enzymatic activity of ACs is carefully controlled by a variety of molecules, including G-protein subunits that can both stimulate and inhibit cAMP production. Using homology models developed from existing structural data, we have carried out all-atom, microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations on the AC5 isoform of adenylyl cyclase and on its complexes with ATP and with the stimulatory G-protein subunit Gsα. The results show that both ATP and Gsα binding have significant effects on the structure and flexibility of adenylyl cyclase. New data on ATP bound to AC5 in the absence of Gsα notably help to explain how Gsα binding enhances enzyme activity and could aid product release. Simulations also suggest a possible coupling between ATP binding and interactions with the inhibitory G-protein subunit Gαi. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations were performed with the GROMACS 5 package. The simulations were carried out in an NTP ensemble at a temperature of 310 K and a pressure of 1 bar using a Bussi velocity-rescaling thermostat  (tT = 1 ps) and a Parrinello-Rahman barostat (tP = 1 ps).  We provide the atomistic trajectories of the following 6 systems after 400 ns of equilibration: AC5 AC5+ATP AC5+Gsα AC5+ATP+Gsα AC5+FOK AC5+ATP+FOK In each trajectory, the frames are saved each 20 ps.	1586.0
zenodo	Intermolecular interactions in G protein-coupled receptor allosteric sites at the membrane interface from molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemical calculations	Allosteric modulators are called to be promising candidates in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) drug development by displaying target selectivity and fewer side effects. Among the allosteric sites known to date, extrahelical cavities represent an uncharacteristic binding location that raises many questions about the ligand interactions and stability; the binding site structure, and how all of these are affected by lipid molecules. In this work, we analyze the dynamics and interactions in the PAR2, C5aR1, and GCGR receptors unbound and bound to allosteric modulators at the receptor-lipid interface using molecular dynamics simulations in three lipid compositions. In addition, we performed quantum chemical calculations to further explore electrostatic interactions and the strength of atom pairwise contacts in the stabilization of the ligand-receptor complexes. We show that besides classical hydrogen bonds weak polar interactions such as O-HC, O-Br, and S-HC contacts and aromatic interactions contribute to the binding of allosteric modulators at the extrahelical sites in the middle of the membrane. The allosteric cavities are open and detectable in various membrane compositions but not always predicted as druggable.  The availability of polar atoms for interactions in such cavities can be assessed by water molecules from the simulations. Although ligand-lipid interactions are weak, the lipid tails play a role in sizing and shaping the large part of the allosteric cavity.  You will find the following files: Input files of the equilibration and production protocols of MD simulations (MD_simulations_inputs.zip) Input files and coordinate files of F-SAPT and NCIPLOT calculations (quantum_chemical_coordiates_inputs.zip) 	1912.0
zenodo	On equilibrating non-periodic molecular dynamics samples for coupled particle-continuum simulations of amorphous polymers: dataset	"Abstract: (from [1]) In the context of fracture simulations of polymers, the molecular mechanisms in the vicinity of the crack tip are of particular interest. Nevertheless, to keep the computational cost to a minimum, a coarser resolution must be used in the remaining regions of the numerical sample. For the specific case of amorphous polymers, the Capriccio method bridges the gap between the length and time scales involved at the different levels of resolution by concurrently coupling molecular dynamics (MD) with the finite element method (FEM). Within the scope of the Capriccio approach, the coupling to the molecular MD region introduces non-periodic, so-called stochastic boundary conditions (SBC). In similarity to typical simulations under periodic boundary conditions (PBC), the SBC MD simulations must reach an equilibrium state before mechanical loads are exerted on the coupled systems. In this contribution, we hence extensively study the equilibration properties of non-periodic MD samples using the Capriccio method. We demonstrate that the relaxation behavior of an MD-FE coupled MD domain utilizing non-periodic boundary conditions is rather insensitive to the specific coupling parameters of the method chosen to implement the boundary conditions. The behavior of an exemplary system equilibrated with the parameter set considered as optimal is further studied under uniaxial tension and we observe some peculiarities in view of creep and relaxation phenomena. This raises important questions to be addressed in the further development of the Capriccio method.   Contact: Felix Weber Institute of Applied Mechanics Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg Egerlandstr. 5 91058 Erlangen Germany   Context: This dataset contains the results presented in [1] and related data.

zenodo	Characterization of the material behavior and identification of effective elastic moduli based on molecular dynamics simulations of coarse-grained silica: dataset	"Abstract: (from [1]) The addition of fillers can significantly improve the mechanical behavior of polymers. The responsible mechanisms at the molecular level can be well assessed by particle-based simulation techniques, such as molecular dynamics. However, the high computational cost of these simulations prevents the study of macroscopic samples. Continuum-based approaches, particularly micromechanics, offer a more efficient alternative but require precise constitutive models for all constituents, which are usually unavailable at these small length scales. In this contribution, we derive a molecular-dynamics-informed constitutive law by employing a characterization strategy introduced in a previous publication. We choose silicon dioxide (silica) as an exemplary filler material used in polymer composites and perform uniaxial and shear deformation tests with molecular dynamics. The material exhibits elastoplastic behavior with a pronounced anisotropy. Based on the pseudo-experimental data, we calibrate an anisotropic elastic constitutive law and reproduce the material response for small strains accurately.   The study validates the characterization strategy that facilitates the calibration of constitutive laws from molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, the obtained material model for coarse-grained silica forms the basis for future continuum-based investigations of polymer nanocomposites. In general, the presented transition from a fine-scale particle model to a coarse and  computationally efficient continuum description adds to the body of knowledge of molecular science as well as the engineering community.   Contact: Maximilian Ries Institute of Applied Mechanics Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg Egerlandstr. 5 91058 Erlangen Software: All simulations were performed with LAMMPS [3], version: 29 Oct 2020 / 20201029 Compiled with Compiler: GNU C++ 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-39) with OpenMP not enabled C++ standard: C++11 Active compile time flags: -DLAMMPS_GZIP -DLAMMPS_SMALLBIG Installed packages: CLASS2, KSPACE, MANYBODY, MC, MOLECULE, MPIIO, OPT, VORONOI, USER-INTEL, USER-MISC, USER-MOLFILE, USER-NETCD License: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International   Context: Data set supplementing  journal paper: [1] Ries, M.; Bauer, C.; Weber, F.; Steinmann, P. & Pfaller, S., ""Characterization of the material behavior and identification of effective elastic moduli based on molecular dynamics simulations of coarse-grained silica"", Mathematics and Mechanics of Solids, 2022, 108128652211080.

zenodo	Structural dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein induced by RNA binding	"This dataset contains files of the molecular dynamics simulations performed in ""Structural dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein induced by RNA binding"" study. Further information in presented in README.md file and the abstract of the study is presented below: ""The nucleocapsid (N) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causal agent of COVID-19, is a multifunction phosphoprotein that plays critical roles in the virus life cycle, including transcription and packaging of the viral RNA. To play such diverse roles, the N protein has two globular RNA-binding modules, the N- (NTD) and C-terminal (CTD) domains, which are connected by an intrinsically disordered region. Despite the wealth of structural data available for the isolated NTD and CTD, how these domains are arranged in the full-length protein and how the oligomerization of N influences its RNA-binding activity remains largely unclear. Herein, using experimental data from electron microscopy and biochemical/biophysical techniques combined with molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, we showed that, in the absence of RNA, the N protein formed structurally dynamic dimers, with the NTD and CTD arranged in extended conformations. However, in the presence of RNA, the N protein assumed a more compact conformation where the NTD and CTD are packed together. We also provided an octameric model for the full-length N bound to RNA that was consistent with electron microscopy images of the N protein in the presence of RNA. Together, our results shed new light on the dynamics and higher-order oligomeric structure of this versatile protein."""	1701.0
zenodo	Function and evolution of B-Raf loop dynamics relevant to cancer recurrence under drug inhibition	Oncogenic mutations in the kinase domain of the B-Raf protein have long been associated with cancers involving the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway. One constitutive ERK activating mutation in B-Raf, the V600E (valine to glutamate) replacement occurring adjacent to a site of threonine phosphorylation (T599) occurs in many types of cancer, and in a large percentage of certain cancers, such as melanoma. Because natural ATP binding activity and the V600E mutation are both known to alter the physical behavior of the activation loop in the ATP binding domain, this system is especially amenable to comparative functional analyses using molecular dynamics of drug classes and genetic variants at all-atom resolution. Here, we employ machine learning enabled identification of functionally conserved protein dynamics to compare how disease pertinent molecular variations impact conserved loop dynamics during the binding of four ATP competitive B-Raf inhibitors (sorafenib, vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and PLX7904) that differ in their effectiveness in preventing cancer recurrence. We demonstrate that drug development targeting B-Raf has progressively moved towards ATP competitive inhibitors that demonstrate less tendency to mimic the functional dynamic shifts associated with ATP binding in this domain. We argue this functional dynamic mimicry in first generation B-Raf inhibitors increases the side effect of hyperactivation (i.e. inducing MAPK activation in non-tumorous cells in the absence of secondary mutation). Within the context of the binding interaction of each inhibitor, we compare the functional dynamic impacts of V600E and other sensitizing and drug resistance causing mutations in the activation and P-loops, confirming sites of low mutational tolerance in these two functional regions. Lastly, we investigate V600E sensitivity of B-Raf loop dynamics in an evolutionary context, demonstrating that while it probably shares partial origin with its early evolution in primitive eukaryotes, the functional sensitivity to V600E was secondarily increased during early jawed vertebrate evolution.	2192.0

zenodo	Applying a generic and fast coarse-grained molecular dynamics model to extensively study the mechanical behavior of polymer nanocomposites: supplementary information and dataset	Abstract: (from [1]) The addition of nano-sized filler particles enhances the mechanical performance of polymers. The resulting properties of the polymer nanocomposite depend on a complex interplay of influence factors such as material pairing, filler size, and content as well as filler-matrix adhesion. As a complement to experimental studies, numerical methods, such as molecular dynamics (MD), facilitate an isolated examination of the individual factors in order to understand their interaction better. However, particle-based simulations are, in general, computationally very expensive, rendering a thorough investigation of nanocomposites’ mechanical behavior both expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, this paper presents a fast coarse-grained MD model for a generic nanoparticle-reinforced thermoplastic. First, we examine the matrix and filler phase individually, which exhibit isotropic elasto-viscoplastic and anisotropic elastic behavior, respectively. Based on this, we demonstrate that the effect of filler size, filler content, and filler-matrix adhesion on the stiffness and strength of the nanocomposite corresponds very well with experimental findings in the literature. Consequently, the presented computationally efficient MD model enables the analysis of a generic polymer nanocomposite. In addition to the obtained insights into the mechanical behavior, the material characterization provides the basis for a future continuum mechanical description, which bridges the gap to the engineering scale.    Contact: Maximilian Ries Institute of Applied Mechanics Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg Egerlandstr. 5 91058 Erlangen Software: All MD simulations were performed with LAMMPS [2], version: 29 Oct 2020 / 20201029 Compiled with Compiler: GNU C++ 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-39) with OpenMP not enabled C++ standard: C++11 Active compile time flags: -DLAMMPS_GZIP -DLAMMPS_SMALLBIG Installed packages: CLASS2, KSPACE, MANYBODY, MC, MOLECULE, MPIIO, OPT, VORONOI, USER-INTEL, USER-MISC, USER-MOLFILE, USER-NETCD Polymer and polymer composite samples generated with self-avoiding random-walk algorithm [3] Post-processing Matlab R2019b Evaluation of polymer entanglements with Z1-Algorithm [4]   License: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International   Context: Data set supplementing  journal paper: [1] M.

zenodo	Molecular recognition and dynamics of linear poly-ubiquitins: integrating coarse-grain simulations and experiments	Poly-ubiquitin chains are flexible multidomain proteins, whose conformational dynamics enable their molecular recognition by a large number of partners in multiple biological pathways. By using alternative linkage, it is possible to obtain poly-ubiquitin molecules with different dynamical properties. This flexibility is further increased by the possibility to tune the length of poly-ubiquitin chains. Characterizing the dynamics of poly-ubiquitins as a function of their length is thus relevant to understand their biology. Structural characterization of poly-ubiquitin conformational dynamics is challenging both experimentally and computationally due to increasing system size and conformational variability. Here, by developing highly efficient and accurate small-angle X-ray scattering driven Martini coarse-grain simulations, we characterize the dynamics of linear M1-linked di-, tri- and tetra-ubiquitin chains. Our data show that the behavior of the di-ubiquitin subunits is independent of the presence of additional ubiquitin modules. We propose that the conformational space sampled by linear poly-ubiquitins, in general, may follow a simple self-avoiding polymer model. These results, combined with experimental data from small angle X-ray scattering, biophysical techniques and additional simulations show that binding of NEMO, a central regulator in the NF-κB pathway, to linear poly-ubiquitin obeys a 2:1 (NEMO:poly-ubiquitin) stoichiometry in solution, even in the context of four ubiquitin units. Eventually, we show how the conformational properties of long poly-ubiquitins may modulate the binding with their partners in a length-dependent manner.	1781.0

zenodo	Data from: Energy landscape for the insertion of amphiphilic nanoparticles into lipid membranes: a computational study	Amphiphilic, monolayer-protected gold nanoparticles (NPs) have been shown to enter cells via a non-endocytic, non-disruptive pathway that could be valuable for biomedical applications. The same NPs were also found to insert into a series of model cell membranes as a precursor to cellular uptake, but the insertion mechanism remains unclear. Previous simulations have demonstrated that an amphiphilic NP can insert into a single leaflet of a planar lipid bilayer, but in this configuration all charged end groups are localized to one side of the bilayer and it is unknown if further insertion is thermodynamically favorable. Here, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to show that an amphiphilic NP can reach the bilayer midplane non-disruptively if charged ligands iteratively ``flip'' across the bilayer. Ligand flipping is a favorable process that relaxes bilayer curvature, decreases the nonpolar solvent-accessible surface area of the NP monolayer, and increases attractive ligand-lipid electrostatic interactions. Analysis of end group hydration further indicates that iterative ligand flipping can occur on experimentally relevant timescales. Supported by these results, we present a complete energy landscape for the non-disruptive insertion of amphiphilic NPs into lipid bilayers. These findings will help guide the design of NPs to enhance bilayer insertion and non-endocytic cellular uptake, and also provide physical insight into a possible pathway for the translocation of charged biomacromolecules.	1641.0

George* “Self-Sorted, Random and Block Supramolecular Co-polymers via Sequence Controlled, Multicomponent Self-Assembly” J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2020, 142, 7606-7617 Multicomponent supramolecular copolymerization promises to construct complex nanostructures with emergent properties. However, even with two monomeric components, various possible outcomes such as self-sorted supramolecular homopolymers, a random (statistical) supramolecular copolymer, an alternate supramolecular copolymer, or a complex supramolecular block copolymer can occur, determined by their intermolecular interactions and monomer exchange dynamics and hence structural prediction is extremely challenging. Herein, we target this challenge and demonstrate unprecedented two-component sequence controlled supramolecular copolymerization by manipulating thermodynamic and kinetic routes in the pathway complexity of selfassembly of the constitutive monomers. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations provided useful mechanistic insights into the monomer exchange rates and free energy of interactions between the monomers that dictate the self-assembly pathway and sequence. The fluorescent nature of core-substituted naphthalene diimide monomers has been further utilized to characterize the three sequences via Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM).	1648.0

zenodo	Block chemistry for accurate modeling of epoxy resins	"## Abstract from [1]: Accurate molecular modelling of the physical and chemical behavior of highly cross-linked epoxy resins at the atomistic scale is important for the design of new property-optimized materials. However, a systematic approach to parametrizing and characterizing these systems in molecular dynamics is missing. We, therefore, present a unified scheme to derive atomic charges for amine-based epoxy resins, in agreement with the AMBER force field, based on defining reactive fragments – blocks – building the network. The approach is applicable to all stages of curing, from pure liquid, to gelation, to fully cured glass. We utilize this approach to study DGEBA/DDS epoxy systems, incorporating dynamic topology changes into atomistic Molecular Dynamics simulations of the curing reaction with 127,000 atoms. We study size effects in our simulations and predict the gel point utilizing rigorous percolation theory to accurately recover the experimental data. Furthermore, we observe excellent agreement between the estimated and the experimentally determined glass transition temperatures as a function of curing rate. Finally, we demonstrate the quality of our model by the prediction of the elastic modulus, based on uniaxial tensile tests. The presented scheme paves the way for a broadly consistent approach for modelling and characterizing all amine-based epoxy resins. ## Contact Ana-Sunčana Smith and Christian R.

zenodo	"Supplemental material for ""Computational study of the dissolution of cellulose into single chains: the role of the solvent and agitation"""	"Input-scripts and data-files from the Cellulose article ""Computational study of the dissolution of cellulose into single chains: the role of the solvent and agitation"" by Bering, E., Torstensen, J., Lervik, A., Wijn, A. S. # Content The folder ""glycamstructures"" contains the output from GLYCAM carbohydrate builder with force-field parameters, coordinates and topology of a single chain of cellulose composed of 4 cellobiose units. The folder ""intermol"" contains the output from the software Intermol were the content of ""glycamstructures"" is translated into the lingo of LAMMPS. The folder ""packmol"" contains input files for the software Packmol, which was used for creating coordinate-files for solvated systems of cellulose with water and cellulose with the solvent mixture. (The bash-script clean.sh fixes the formatting of the .xyz-files such that LAMMPS can read it.) The folder ""36bundle"" contains input files for creating the initial configuration of the bundle with 36 chains in a maze configuration, namely 36bundle.sh reads 1chain.xyz to make the coordinate file 36bundle.xyz. Further, nvt00.in is the initial LAMMPS script for slowly starting up this system with the NVT-ensemble, which reads system information from the LAMMPS-datafile chain.36bundle, cellulose parameters from the LAMMPS-datafile data.cellulose_nohybrid and coordinates from 36bundle.xyz. nvt01.in and nvt02.in continues sequentially, resulting in the configuration stored in the LAMMPS data-file chain.nvt02. The folder ""36bundle_mix"" continues from 36bundle by first adding the solvent mixture with coordinates from Packmol in the file 36bm.xyz and slowly starting up in the NVT-ensemble with nvt00.in, with force-field parameters in data.cellulose.in, data.water_spce.in, data.naoh.in and data.urea.in, with charges and connectivity of the solvent molecules in the files water_spce.txt, naoh.txt and urea.txt. The LAMMPS script npt00.in continues with the NPT-ensemble, which is continued with npt01.in etc., resulting in the configuration stored in the LAMMPS data-file chain.npt06. These systems can be continued with length- or force-controlled oscillatory stretching/compression with osc_length.in and osc_force.in respectively, which was used to make the configurations stored in the LAMMPS data-files chain.osc_length4 and chain.osc_force4. Similarly, the folder ""36bundle_water"" continues from 36bundle by first adding the water with coordinates from Packmol in the file 36bw.xyz and slowly starting up in the NVT-ensemble with nvt00.in, with force-field parameters in data.cellulose.in and data.water_spce.in, with charges and connectivity of the water molecules in the file water_spce.txt. Again, these systems can be continued with length- or force-controlled oscillatory stretching/compression with osc_length.in and osc_force.in respectively, which was used to make the configurations stored in the LAMMPS data-files chain.osc_length4 and chain.osc_force4."	3090.0
zenodo	Thriving in the heat – Lysine acetylation stabilizes the quaternary structure of a Mega-Dalton hyperthermoactive PEP-synthase	Over time structural adaptations enabled proteins and enzymes to have sufficient stability and flexibility to perform the basic functions of life under various environmental conditions. The catalytic cores of key metabolic enzymes of hyperthermophilic archaea work at a temperature range of 80-120 °C, similar to the conditions wher the earliest life forms may have thrived. Here we characterize a key enzyme of the central carbon metabolism of Pyrococcus furious, through an integrative approach combining structural mass spectrometry, cryo-electron microscopy, mass photometry and molecular modelling with molecular dynamics simulations. From our investigation, we unveil the structural organization of phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (PPSA). Its 24-meric assembly - weighing over 2 MDa - harbors flexible distal domains, whose proper functioning and coordination depends on widespread chemical acetylation of lysine residues. This non-enzymatic post-translational modification, along with other types of lysine modifications, also occurs on most other major protein complexes of P. furiosus. These modifications likely originated in the chemically favorable primordial conditions and gradually became highly specialized and enzyme-driven in more distantly related mesophiles and Eukaryotes. Molecular dynamics simulations and analysis – The all-atom structures of the full c1(X4) 24-mer PPSA models, carrying highly acetylated sites at 14 positions (106, 120,185, 187, 427, 466, 492, 496, 557, 574, 641, 726, 737, 805) or unmodified lysines were coarse grained (CG), mapping their atoms to the SIRAH force field (ff), that uses a classical Hamiltonian common to most all-atom potentials to describe particle–particle interactions, and recently extended to support the PTMs most commonly found on proteins(Garay et al., 2020). Both starting structures contained a disulfide bond between Cys42-Cys189 as well as phosphorylation of Thr440. All starting structures, simulation boxes and parameters files used for the minimization, equilibration and production are provided (Supplementary Data 5). Simulation was conducted in GROMACS 2020.4(Hess et al., 2008), for which code can be found here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5636522. The 24-aly system consisted of 94128 CG atoms for the protein representation, solvated with 179271 WT4 CG water beads (Garay et al., 2020). A neutral charge was achieved adding 6617 NaW (Na+) and 5633 ClW (Cl-), corresponding to a concentration of approximately 150 mM NaCl concentration. The 24-lys system was also prepared accordingly and consisted of 93456 CG atoms for the protein, 186690 WT4 CG water beads and neutralized with 6503 NaW (Na+) and 5855 ClW (Cl-). Solvation was done using the default radii of 0.105 nm for atoms not present in the VdW database (vdwradii.dat) and then removing the WT4 molecules within 0.3 nm from the solute. In all cases, eventual clashes were relaxed during the solute-restrained energy minimization. Due to the length of the loops connecting the 3 domains, an alternative configuration of the tetramers where the CD-NBD domains are sitting on top of the neighboring PPSA subunit is also possible (see Supplementary Note 1). This was named “alternative” (a) configuration, as opposed to the “original” (o), thus producing 4 starting models: a24-aly, o24-aly, a24-lys and o24-lys (Supplementary Data 5). All these configurations were subjected to a first round of production consisting of 125 ns in duplicate to define the stable configuration for further extension of the simulation time to 500 ns. The main stages of the simulation can be summarized as follows:1) solvent and side-chain relaxation by 2 stages of 20’000 steps of energy minimization, imposing positional restraints of 1000 kJ mol-1 nm-2 on the whole protein (stage 1) and only on backbone beads (GN and GO, stage 2); 2) solvent NVT ensemble equilibration with a first stage where the temperature was slowly increased from 303K to 363K in 7 steps of 4 ns each, and a second stage to equilibrate the protein by gradually releasing the positional restraints from 1000 kJ mol-1 nm-2  on the backbone beads (GN and GO) to 100 kJ mol-1 nm-2 on the C-terminus to compensate for the missing stabilization effect of the Met799-Fe cluster; 3) production simulation of an additional 80 ns in NPT ensemble at 363 K and 1 bar imposing positional restraints of 100 kJ mol-1 nm-2 on the C-terminus. Non-bonded interactions were treated with a 1.2 nm cutoff and PME for long-range electrostatics. An integration time-step of 15 fs was used during MD production runs. The system pressure was controlled by the Parrinello-Rahman barostat (Parrinello and Rahman, 1981) with a coupling time of 4 ps. The positional restraints during the production simulation were necessary to maintain the overall system at the high energy of the particles at 363 K (90 ˚C), the temperature mimicking the near-optimum temperature for PPSA catalytic activity. All simulations were run in duplicate. Although the simulations do not accurately reflect the possible dynamics of the protein in native conditions, the computational challenges of simulating >350000 atoms for the protein only drove us to use a CG representation of the system.  To analyze the trajectories, every functional module (tetramer) was extracted from the simulation of the full 24-mer for each replicate, resulting in two sets of 12 independent trajectories (6 for each 24-mer) either with and without acetylated Lysine residues. To produce morphed movies and analyze secondary structure and interfaces, the CG tetramers trajectories were back mapped to atomistic detail using SIRAH tools via VMD. A back mapped atomistic model was produced every 35.7 ns, and subjected to 100 cycles of energy minimization in AMBER, resulting in 14 atomistic models describing each trajectory of a given tetramer over the 500 ns of simulation, further interpolated in ChimeraX using the morph command to produce the atomistic representation of the dynamics (Supplementary Data 5). RMSD calculation and trajectory analysis were done with the MDanalysis suite(Michaud-Agrawal et al., 2011). Each probability density in Figure 5B and 5C is calculated over two independent coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of the last 250 ns of production of the PPSA 24-mer in the acetylated and non-acetylated form, using a snapshot frequency of 5 ns. In Figure 5B, the RMSD of the Cα atoms (equivalent to backbone GC beads in CG MD) of the NBD region (residues 1-365) in the tetramer form was calculated with respect to their conformation in the tetramer PPSA resting state. The six trajectories of all six tetramers included in the simulated PPSA complex, resulting in 3 μs ([250ns*6]*2) of accumulated tetramer simulation, were used in the probability density calculation. In Figure 5C, the RMSD of the Cα atoms (equivalent to backbone GC beads in CG MD) was calculated over the CD (residues 379-481) and PBD (residues 510-790) regions with respect to the modelled CD-PBD state of PPSA in the monomer form. All 24 PPSA monomers of which the simulated PPSA complex was composed were included in the probability density calculation, resulting in 12 μs ([250ns*24]*2) of accumulated PPSA monomer simulation.  	7383.0
zenodo	Binding Modes of Ligands Using Enhanced Sampling (BLUES): Rapid Decorrelation of Ligand Binding Modes via Nonequilibrium Candidate Monte Carlo	Accurately predicting protein-ligand binding affinities and binding modes is a major goal in computational chemistry, but even the prediction of ligand binding modes in proteins poses major challenges. Here, we focus on solving the binding mode prediction problem for rigid fragments. That is, we focus on computing the dominant placement, conformation, and orientations of a relatively rigid, fragment-like ligand in a receptor, and the populations of the multiple binding modes which may be relevant. This problem is important in its own right, but is even more timely given the recent success of alchemical free energy calculations. Alchemical calculations are increasingly used to predict binding free energies of ligands to receptors. However, the accuracy of these calculations is dependent on proper sam- pling of the relevant ligand binding modes. Unfor- tunately, ligand binding modes may often be uncer- tain, hard to predict, and/or slow to interconvert on simulation timescales, so proper sampling with cur- rent techniques can require prohibitively long sim- ulations. We need new methods which dramatically improve sampling of ligand binding modes. Here, we develop and apply a nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) method to improve sampling of ligand binding modes. In this technique, the ligand is rotated and subsequently allowed to relax in its new position through alchemical perturbation before accepting or rejecting the rotation and relaxation as a nonequilibrium Monte Carlo move. When applied to a T4 lysozyme model binding system, this NCMC method shows over two orders of magnitude improvement in binding mode sampling efficiency compared to a brute force molecular dynamics sim- ulation. This is a first step towards applying this methodology to pharmaceutically-relevant binding of fragments and, eventually, drug-like molecules. We are making this approach available via our new Binding Modes of Ligands using Enhanced Sampling (BLUES) package which is freely available on GitHub.	2158.0
zenodo	Structural basis of Omicron immune evasion: A comparative computational study of Spike protein-Antibody interaction	The COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 424 million infections and 5.9 million deaths so far. The vaccines used against SARS-COV-2 by now have been able to develop some neutralising antibodies in the vaccinated human population and slow down the infection rate. The effectiveness of the vaccines has been challenged by the emergence of the new strains with numerous mutations in the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Since S protein is the major immunogenic protein of the virus and also contains Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) that interacts with the human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, any mutations in this region should affect the neutralisation potential of the antibodies leading to the immune evasion. Several variants of concern (VOC) of the virus have emerged so far. Among them, the most critical are Delta (B.1.617.2), and recently reported Omicron (B. 1.1.529) which have acquired a lot of mutations in the spike protein. We have mapped those mutations on the modelled RBD and evaluated the binding affinities of various human antibodies with it. Docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies have been used to explore the effect of the mutations on the structure of the RBD and the RBD-antibody interaction. The analysis shows that the mutations mostly at the interface of a nearby region lower the binding affinity of the antibody by ten to forty per cent, with a downfall in the number of interactions formed as a whole and therefore, it implies the generation of immune escape variants. Notable mutations and their effect was characterised by performing various analyses that explain the structural basis of antibody efficacy in Delta and a compromised neutralisation effect for the Omicron variant. Our results pave the way for robust vaccine design that can be effective for many variants.	1947.0

Obadiya and D. M. Sussman, arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.00604, (2022). It has three subfolders (described below); all data has been stored in Python's pickle format using protocol version 4, with the pickled files structured as dictionaries. ## ""Trajectories/"" folder Each file in this folder is the raw saved output of a molecular dynamics simulation of an 80:20 Kob-Andersen mixture. To generate the trajectories of particles in this mixture, we first equilibrated a system with random initial conditions for 5000 tau at a temperature of T=0.45. We used the final configuration of this as an initial seed for our other simulations: a snapshot was loaded as the initial configuration for our other simulations, each of which was allowed to equilibrate for 1000 tau at its target temperature. The simulations were done in an NVT ensemble with the coupling constant of the thermostat set to 10 tau. The simulations were evolved using a timestep of dt = 0.001 tau, with frames saved every 1 tau. Each file name contains the temperature at which the simulation was run, and all simulations are of a set of N=4096 particles. The pickle dictionary for each file contains three elements. ""Box_size"" contains an array of three elements describing the cubic box simulation box's size along the x, y, and z axes. ""Particle types"" has a list of 4096 integers with 0 corresponding to a particle of type A and 1 corresponding to a particle of type B. ""Positions"" contains the particle positions for every frame in the saved trajectory. ## ""Training_data_V1/"" folder This folder contains the training data for five training temperatures used in the above paper. The paper considered two different training sets (defined by using either phop or cumulative squared displacement as the dynamical label), and the training sets corresponding to this choice of dynamical label are in the corresponding subfolders. Within each subfolder, the file name indicates the temperature at which the data were obtained. The pickle dictionary for each file contains two elements. ""X_train_rawdata"" for every particle in the training set, this contains a list of 100 local structural features (corresponding to the AA and AB local radial distribution functions described in the paper above -- all particles in the training set are particles of type A); the ""rawdata"" part of the name indicates that these features have not been standardized. ""Y_train"" is the corresponding dynamical label, with 1 indicating a large value of dynamical label and a -1 indicating a small value of the dynamical label. ## ""Training_data_V2/"" folder This folder contains similar training data for the same five training temperatures, but does not make any assumptions about how to define the local structural features. The pickle dictionaries have the same names as in the Training_data_V1, and the ""Y_train"" element has the same structure. Here, though, ""X_train_rawdata"" for each element contains a list of 4-vectors that correspond to the positions of all particles within 5 sigma of the particle whose dynamical label is being considered. The first 3 elements of each 4-vector give the relative separation between the target particle and its neighboring particle, and the 4th element is the particle type of the neighboring particle (0 for particles of type A, and 1 for particles of type B).  "	3525.0

zenodo	A quantitative interphase model for polymer nanocomposites: Verification, validation, and consequences regarding size effects: dataset	Abstract: (from [1]) The enhanced mechanical behavior of polymer nanocomposites with spherical filler particles is attributed to the formation of matrix-filler interphases. The nano-scale leads to particularly high interphase volume fractions while rendering experimental investigations extremely difficult. Previously, we introduced a molecular dynamics-based interphase model capturing the crucial spatial profiles of elastic and inelastic properties inside the interphase. This contribution demonstrates that our model captures polymer nanocomposites’ essential characteristics reported from experiments. To this end, we thoroughly verify and validate the model before discussing the resulting local plastic strain distribution. Furthermore, we obtain a reinforcement in terms of the overall stiffness for smaller particles and higher filler contents, while the influence of particle spacing seems negligible, matching experimental observations in the literature. This paper proposes a methodology to unravel the underlying complex mechanical behavior of polymer nanocomposites and to translate the findings into engineering quantities accessible to a broader audience and technical applications.   Contact: Maximilian Ries Institute of Applied Mechanics Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg Egerlandstr. 5 91058 Erlangen Software: Abaqus version R2018 License: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International   Context: Data set supplementing  journal paper: [1] Ries, M.; Weber, F.; Possart, G.; Steinmann, P. & Pfaller, S., “A quantitative interphase model for polymer nanocomposites: Verification, validation, and consequences regarding size effects”, Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 2022, 107094.

Sometimes, extra tensions, shears, or temperature gradients are introduced to those simulations to probe one type of nonequilibrium response to external forces. Catalysts and molecular motors, however, function based on the nonequilibrium dynamics induced by a chemical reaction's thermodynamic driving force. In this scenario, simulations require chemostats capable of preserving the chemical concentrations of the nonequilibrium steady state. We develop such a dynamic scheme and use it to observe cycles of a new particle-based classical model of a catenane-like molecular motor. Molecular motors are frequently modeled with detailed-balance-breaking Markov models, and we explicitly construct such a picture by coarse graining the microscopic dynamics of our simulations in order to extract rates. This work identifies inter-particle interactions that tune those rates to create a functional motor, thereby yielding a computational playground to investigate the interplay between directional bias, current generation, and coupling strength in molecular information ratchets."	1705.0

figshare	Predicting the mechanism and rate of H-NS binding to AT-rich DNA	 Bacteria contain several nucleoid-associated proteins that organize their genomic DNA into the nucleoid by bending, wrapping or bridging DNA. The Histone-like Nucleoid Structuring protein H-NS is a DNA bridging protein and can structure DNA by binding to two separate DNA duplexes or to adjacent sites on the same duplex, depending on external conditions. H-NS occurs in enterobacteria and influences the expression of genes. Several nucleotide sequences have been identified to which H-NS binds with high affinity, indicating H-NS prefers AT-rich DNA. To date, highly detailed structural information of the H-NS DNA complex remains elusive. Molecular simulation can complement experiments by modelling structures and their time evolution in atomistic detail. In this paper we report an exploration of the different binding modes of H-NS to a high affinity nucleotide sequence and an estimate of the associated rate constant. By means of molecular dynamics simulations, we identified three types of binding for H-NS to AT-rich DNA. To further sample the transitions between these binding modes, we performed Replica Exchange Transition Interface Sampling, providing predictions of the mechanism and rate constant of H-NS binding to DNA. H-NS interacts with the DNA through a conserved QGR motif, aided by a conserved arginine at position 93. The QGR motif interacts first with phosphate groups, followed by the formation of hydrogen bonds between acceptors in the DNA minor groove and the sidechains of either Q112 or R114. After R114 inserts into the minor groove, the rest of the QGR motif follows. Full insertion of the QGR motif in the minor groove is stable over several tens of nanoseconds, and involves hydrogen bonds between the bases and both backbone and sidechains of the QGR motif. The rate constant for the process of H-NS binding to AT-rich DNA resulting in full insertion of the QGR motif is in the order of 106 M−1s−1, which is rate limiting compared to the non-specific association of H-NS to the DNA backbone. 	2093.0
figshare	Determining structure and action mechanism of LBF14 by molecular simulation	The recently discovered, membrane–active peptide LBF14 contains several non–proteinogenic amino acids and is able to transform vesicles into tubule networks. The exact membrane interaction mechanism and detailed secondary structure are yet to be determined. We performed molecular dynamics simulations of LBF14 and let it fold de novo into its ensemble of native secondary structures. Histidine protonation state effects on secondary structure were investigated. An MD simulation of the peptide with a lipid bilayer was performed. Simulation results were compared to circular dichroism and electron paramagnetic resonance data of previous studies. LBF14 contains a conserved helical section in an otherwise random structure. Helical stability is influenced by histidine protonation. The peptide localized to the polar layer of the membrane, consistent with experimental results. While the overall secondary structure is unaffected by membrane interaction, Ramachandran plot analysis yielded two distinct peptide conformations during membrane interaction. This conformational change was accompanied by residue repositioning within the membrane. LBF14 only affected the local order in the membrane, and had no measurable effect on pressure. The simulation results are consistent with the previously proposed membrane interaction mechanism of LBF14 and can additionally explain the local interaction mechanism. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

figshare	Organic and Third Phase in HNO3/TBP/n-Dodecane System: No Reverse Micelles	The composition and speciation of the organic and third phases in the system HNO3/TBP (tri-n-butyl phosphate)/n-dodecane have been examined by a combination of gravimetric, Karl Fischer analysis, chemical analysis, FTIR, and 31P NMR spectroscopy, with particular emphasis on the transition from the two-phase to the three-phase region. Phase densities indicate that third-phase formation takes place for initial aqueous HNO3 concentrations above 15 M, while the results from the stoichiometric analysis imply that the organic and third phases are characterized by two distinct species, namely the mono-solvate TBP⋅HNO3 and the hemi-solvate TBP⋅2HNO3, respectively. Furthermore, the 31P NMR spectra of organic and third phase show no significant chemical differences at the phosphorus centers, suggesting that the second HNO3 molecule in the third phase is bound to HNO3 rather than TBP. The third-phase FTIR spectra reveal stronger vibrational absorption bands at 1028, 1310, 1653, and 3200–3500 cm−1, reflecting higher concentrations of H2O, HNO3, and TBP. The molecular dynamics simulation data predict structures in accord with the spectroscopically identified speciation, indicating inequivalent HNO3 molecules in the third phase. The predicted structures of the organic and third phases are more akin to microemulsion networks rather than the distinct, reverse micelles assumed in previous studies. H2O appears to be present as a disordered hydrogen-bonded solvate stabilizing the polar TBP/HNO3 aggregates in the organic matrix, and not as a strongly bound hydrate species in aggregates with defined stoichiometry.	1694.0

figshare	Investigation of nanotubes as the smart carriers for targeted delivery of mercaptopurine anticancer drug	Mercaptopurine (MCP) is an anticancer drug that is used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The therapeutic effect of the mercaptopurine limits its severe side effects like other cytotoxic (anti-cancer) drugs. Nanostructures or nanoparticles can be widely used as potential drug carriers for diagnosis and treatment of cancer. In the current study, the boron nitride nanotube (BNNT) and carbon nanotube (CNT) were studied as the delivery carriers of MCP using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MDs) simulation studies. To further understand the electronic properties of mercaptopurine, the partial density of states (PDOS) was calculated. The PDOS results depicted that the electronic features of the MCP do not change after the adsorption on the surface of the nanotubes. More stability of the MCP/BNNT complexes may be attributed to the existence of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) between the hydrogen atoms of the MCP molecule and the N atoms of the BNNT. The results of the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) confirmed the presence of H-bonds in these complexes. Moreover, MD simulation studies were done in the presence of five drug molecules. The results revealed that the strongest van der Waals (vdW) interaction energy was found between the BNNT and MCP among the studied nanotubes, indicating the BNNT is a better nanocarrier than carbon nanotube for delivery of the MCP drug within the biological systems. In general, the obtained results may present helpful information on the nature of the interactions between mercaptopurine anticancer drug with BNNT and/or CNT. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

This model includes amino acids 2 to 377 of protein GAG-HIV1 (UNIPROT code P12497) in a compact conformation.md.mdp is a text file with the conditions to generate the molecular dynamics run. The simulation was performed using the GROMACS package version 2018.1 (Abraham et al., 2015) in conjunction with the GROMOS 53A6 force field (Oostenbrink et al., 2004). Water was represented explicitly using the SPC/E model (Berendsen et al.,1987). The system was simulated under periodic conditions in a dodecahedron box. The temperature was maintained throughout the simulation by independently coupling the protein and the solvent to an external temperature bath at 310 K with a coupling constant tau_t= 0.1 ps using a modified Berendsen thermostat (Bussi et al., 2007). The pressure was maintained at 1 bar by weakly coupling the system to an isotropic pressure bath (Parrinello & Rahman., 1981) using an isothermal compressibility of 4.5 x 10-5 bar-1 and a coupling constant of tau_p= 2.0 ps. During the simulations, the length of all bonds within the protein was constrained using the LINear Constraint Solver (LINCS) algorithm (Hess et al. 1997). All bonds, even heavy atom-H bonds were constrained. The time step for integrating the equations of motion was 2 fs.

figshare	Enzyme Inspired Catalysts	Polystyrene fragments containing catalytic and hydrophobic residues were built and simulated using Amber16 package.Parameters for styrene (STY), catalyst (CAT) and hydrophobic (SPA) residues were assigned using Antechamber and General Amber Force Field (GAFF), while the charges were derived using two-stage RESP fitting procedure to the electrostatic potential calculated with Gaussian09 at HF/6-31G(d) level of theory. This level of theory was used to be consistent with GAFF parameterization. Geometry of each residue was optimized in the gas phase and polymer backbone atoms were capped with a methyl group. Styrene monomer was modelled as 2-phenylpropane. The additional methyl group and hydrogen atom were removed in the subsequent step to ensure correct connectivity between the monomers, which was defined with prepgen module of AmberTools. Charges on these capping groups were required to sum to zero and the excess charge was distributed between the remaining atoms. Terminal styrene residues were capped with methyl groups. Identical approach was employed for creating catalyst and hydrophobic residue parameters, except multi-conformer fitting was performed for these molecules due to their conformational flexibility. We used 10 conformers for each molecule in the RESP procedure of partial charge derivation. The uploaded files include prep libraries required for building polystyrene system:* STY: styrene monomer * HST: terminal (head) styrene monomer capped with methyl group* TST: terminal (tail) styrene monomer capped with methyl group* CAT: styrene residue with catalytic moiety attached* SPA: styrene residue with C16 alkyl chain attached* SCL: cross-linking residue (p-divinylbenzene) with 1 additional branching point* SDB: cross-linking residue (p-divinylbenzene) with 2 additional branching points (double-branch)Six fragments containing catalyst and hydrophobic residue separated by 0 to 5 styrene units (EIC-0 to EIC-5) were built, with three additional styrene units added on each side of catalyst and hydrophobic residue. These fragments were then solvated with TIP3P waters in a truncated octahedron box with 10 Å buffer in each direction from the solute. The solvated fragments were relaxed in 4 steps: 1) steepest descent minimization was performed with maximum of 10 000 cycles; 2) slow heating of the system from 0 to 300 K in 100 ps with harmonic position restraints on solute (2.5 kcal/mol Å2) under constant volume (NVT); 3) constant pressure (NPT) dynamics at 300 K for 1 ns with harmonic position restraints placed on solute (2.5 kcal/mol Å2); 4) constant pressure (NPT) dynamics at 300 K without restraints for another 1 ns. After relaxation (total of 2.1 ns), each system was simulated for 100 ns at 300 K under constant volume (NVT). Periodic boundary conditions were used and long range electrostatic interactions were calculated with the Particle-Mesh Ewald (PME) technique with a cutoff of 8.0 Å. The temperature in all simulations was set to 300 K and controlled by Langevin thermostat combined with random seed generator.[6] The SHAKE algorithm[7] was employed to constrain bonds involving hydrogen atoms during dynamics and an integration time step of 2 fs was used. The simulations were carried out using GPU version of PMEMD program implemented in the Amber16 package, saving snapshots every 10 ps. Analysis was performed using cpptraj module available in AmberTools. For clustering, all-atom RMS deviations of catalyst and hydrophobic residues (styrene residues were not included) was used in conjunction with k-means algorithm with maximum number of clusters set to 20. An example input file to build a fragment with these residues using LEaP module of Amber package is provided (build_example.leap), as well as the input files for running molecular dynamics (min.in, heat.in, npt-restr.in, npt.in, nvt.in).

figshare	LNA-induced dynamic stability in a therapeutic aptamer: insights from molecular dynamics simulations	Modulation of structural and thermodynamic properties of nucleic acids with synthetic modifications is a promising area of research with possible applications in nanotechnology and nanotherapeutics. Locked nucleic acid (LNA) is one such modification in which the C4’ and O2’ atoms of the sugar moiety are connected through a methylene bridge. The LNA modified DNA aptamer RNV66, and its unmodified counterpart V7t1, both of which target the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) implicated in oncogenic angiogenesis, have a G-rich tract that can fold into G-quadruplex structures. However, it is not understood why V7t1 has a polymorphic structure while its LNA modified counterpart RNV66 has a unique quadruplex fold with higher nuclease resistance, thermal stability and greater binding affinity for VEGF. In this work, we have performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations of RNV66 and V7t1 to study and compare the structural and dynamic consequences of the insertion of LNAs. It was observed that the increase in dynamic stability was significant in the presence of LNA residues and our protocol for combining different torsional parameters using OL15 for the DNA aptamer and parm99_LNA along with parmbsc0 and βOL15 for the LNAs nicely reproduced the experimentally observed conformational features of RNV66. Our observations would help in further theoretical studies in understanding the lack of frustration in the folding of the LNA modified aptamer and its higher affinity for VEGF.

figshare	Upgraded molecular models of the human KCNQ1 potassium channel	The voltage-gated potassium channel KCNQ1 (KV7.1) assembles with the KCNE1 accessory protein to generate the slow delayed rectifier current, IKS, which is critical for membrane repolarization as part of the cardiac action potential. Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in KCNQ1 are the most common cause of congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), type 1 LQTS, an inherited genetic predisposition to cardiac arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. A detailed structural understanding of KCNQ1 is needed to elucidate the molecular basis for KCNQ1 LOF in disease and to enable structure-guided design of new anti-arrhythmic drugs. In this work, advanced structural models of human KCNQ1 in the resting/closed and activated/open states were developed by Rosetta homology modeling guided by newly available experimentally-based templates: X. leavis KCNQ1 and various resting voltage sensor structures. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the capacity of the models to describe experimentally established channel properties including state-dependent voltage sensor gating charge interactions and pore conformations, PIP2 binding sites, and voltage sensor–pore domain interactions were validated. Rosetta energy calculations were applied to assess the utility of each model in interpreting mutation-evoked KCNQ1 dysfunction by predicting the change in protein thermodynamic stability for 50 experimentally characterized KCNQ1 variants with mutations located in the voltage-sensing domain. Energetic destabilization was successfully predicted for folding-defective KCNQ1 LOF mutants whereas wild type-like mutants exhibited no significant energetic frustrations, which supports growing evidence that mutation-induced protein destabilization is an especially common cause of KCNQ1 dysfunction. The new KCNQ1 Rosetta models provide helpful tools in the study of the structural basis for KCNQ1 function and can be used to generate hypotheses to explain KCNQ1 dysfunction.	2019.0
figshare	Aggregation of Charge Acceptors on Nanocrystal Surfaces Alters Rates of Photoinduced Electron Transfer	Semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) interfaced with molecular ligands that function as charge and energy acceptors are an emerging platform for the design of light-harvesting, photon-upconverting, and photocatalytic materials. However, NC systems explored for these applications often feature high concentrations of bound acceptor ligands, which can lead to ligand–ligand interactions that may alter each system’s ability to undergo charge and energy transfer. Here, we demonstrate that aggregation of acceptor ligands impacts the rate of photoinduced NC-to-ligand charge transfer between lead­(II) sulfide (PbS) NCs and perylenediimide (PDI) electron acceptors. As the concentration of PDI acceptors is increased, we find the average electron transfer rate from PbS to PDI ligands decreases by nearly an order of magnitude. The electron transfer rate slowdown with increasing PDI concentration correlates strongly with the appearance of PDI aggregates in steady-state absorption spectra. Electronic structure calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggest PDI aggregation slows the rate of electron transfer by reducing orbital overlap between PbS charge donors and PDI charge acceptors. While we find aggregation slows electron transfer in this system, the computational models we employ predict ligand aggregation could also be used to speed electron transfer by producing delocalized states that exhibit improved NC-molecule electronic coupling and energy alignment with NC conduction band states. Our results demonstrate that ligand aggregation can alter rates of photoinduced electron transfer between NCs and organic acceptor ligands and should be considered when designing hybrid NC:molecule systems for charge separation.	1843.0
figshare	Anomalous Effects of Velocity Rescaling Algorithms: The Flying Ice Cube Effect Revisited	The flying ice cube effect is a molecular dynamics simulation artifact in which the use of velocity rescaling thermostats sometimes causes violation of the equipartition theorem, affecting both structural and dynamic properties. The reason for this artifact and the conditions under which it occurs have not been fully understood. Since the flying ice cube effect was first demonstrated, a new velocity rescaling algorithm (the CSVR thermostat) has been developed and become popular without its effects on the equipartition theorem being truly known. Meanwhile, the use of simple velocity rescaling and Berendsen (weak coupling) thermostat algorithms has not abated but has actually continued to grow. Here, we have calculated the partitioning of the kinetic energy between translational, rotational, and vibrational modes in simulations of diatomic molecules to explicitly determine whether the equipartition theorem is violated under different thermostats and while rescaling velocities to different kinetic energy distributions. We have found that the underlying cause of the flying ice cube effect is a violation of balance leading to systematic redistributions of kinetic energy under simple velocity rescaling and the Berendsen thermostat. When velocities are instead rescaled to the canonical ensemble’s kinetic energy distribution, as is done with the CSVR thermostat, the equipartition theorem is not violated, and we show that the CSVR thermostat satisfies detailed balance. The critical necessity for molecular dynamics practitioners to abandon the use of popular yet incorrect velocity rescaling algorithms is underscored with an example demonstrating that the main result of a highly cited study is entirely due to artifacts resulting from the study’s use of the Berendsen thermostat.	1885.0
figshare	Expanding the Accessible Chemical Space of SIRT2 Inhibitors through Exploration of Binding Pocket Dynamics	Considerations of binding pocket dynamics are one of the crucial aspects of the rational design of binders. Identification of alternative conformational states or cryptic subpockets could lead to the discovery of completely novel groups of the ligands. However, experimental characterization of pocket dynamics, besides being expensive, may not be able to elucidate all of the conformational states relevant for drug discovery projects. In this study, we propose the protocol for computational simulations of sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) binding pocket dynamics and its integration into the structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) pipeline. Initially, unbiased molecular dynamics simulations of SIRT2:inhibitor complexes were performed using optimized force field parameters of SIRT2 inhibitors. Time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA) was used to design pocket-related collective variables (CVs) for enhanced sampling of SIRT2 pocket dynamics. Metadynamics simulations in the tICA eigenvector space revealed alternative conformational states of the SIRT2 binding pocket and the existence of a cryptic subpocket. Newly identified SIRT2 conformational states outperformed experimentally resolved states in retrospective SBVS validation. After performing prospective SBVS, compounds from the under-represented portions of the SIRT2 inhibitor chemical space were selected for in vitro evaluation. Two compounds, NDJ18 and NDJ85, were identified as potent and selective SIRT2 inhibitors, which validated the in silico protocol and opened up the possibility for generalization and broadening of its application. The anticancer effects of the most potent compound NDJ18 were examined on the triple-negative breast cancer cell line. Results indicated that NDJ18 represents a promising structure suitable for further evaluation.	1926.0
figshare	Infrared Spectra at Coupled Cluster Accuracy from Neural Network Representations	Infrared spectroscopy is key to elucidating molecular structures, monitoring reactions, and observing conformational changes, while providing information on both structural and dynamical properties. This makes the accurate prediction of infrared spectra based on first-principle theories a highly desirable pursuit. Molecular dynamics simulations have proven to be a particularly powerful approach for this task, albeit requiring the computation of energies, forces and dipole moments for a large number of molecular configurations as a function of time. This explains why highly accurate first-principles methods, such as coupled cluster theory, have so far been inapplicable for the prediction of fully anharmonic vibrational spectra of large systems at finite temperatures. Here, we push cutting-edge machine learning techniques forward by using neural network representations of energies, forces, and in particular dipoles to predict such infrared spectra fully at “gold standard” coupled cluster accuracy as demonstrated for protonated water clusters as large as the protonated water hexamer, in its extended Zundel configuration. Furthermore, we show that this methodology can be used beyond the scope of the data considered during the development of the neural network models, allowing for the computation of finite-temperature infrared spectra of large systems inaccessible to explicit coupled cluster calculations. This substantially expands the hitherto existing limits of accuracy, speed, and system size for theoretical spectroscopy and opens up a multitude of avenues for the prediction of vibrational spectra and the understanding of complex intra- and intermolecular couplings.	1772.0
figshare	Aggregation of Asphaltene Subfractions A1 and A2 in Different Solvents from the Perspective of Molecular Dynamics Simulations	The aggregation behavior of model molecules of asphaltene subfractions A1 and A2 dissolved in heptane, toluene, and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were studied using molecular dynamics simulations. The proposed asphaltene molecular models are based on previously studied structures with two new models, including a highly aromatic model with a prominent island-type molecule and another molecule with a prominent archipelago-type architecture. The aggregation mechanisms in toluene, THF, and heptane solvents were studied. The results in heptane and toluene were consistent with the solubility of asphaltenes and their subfractions in these solvents. The size of the aggregates is well-correlated with aromaticity. When considering THF, large aggregates are broken down into smaller aggregates. This could lead to the mixture of high, medium, and low molecular weight distribution bands usually observed when gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analyses are conducted on asphaltene samples in THF. The size distribution extracted from the simulations shows a bimodal distribution with profiles similar to the size distribution profiles usually found in GPC analysis for asphaltene samples in THF. The distributions of dipole moments of the aggregates against the number of molecules in aggregates were constructed in both THF and toluene and reveal that the dipole moment of the aggregates vanishes when the number of molecules increases as a result of a random structure of the aggregates. The contributions of different molecular interactions to the aggregation mechanism, such as π stacking, van der Waals, and hydrogen bonds, are described.	1760.0
figshare	Atomic Mechanisms of Transthyretin Tetramer Dissociation Studied by Molecular Dynamics Simulations	The dissociation of the transthyretin (TTR) tetramer into a monomer is closely related to various TTR amyloidoses in humans. While the tetramer dissociation has been reported to be the rate-limiting step for TTR aggregation, few details are known about the mechanism. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed by combining conventional MD and biased metadynamics to investigate the mechanism for the wild-type (WT) and mutant (T119M) structures. Both were found to have a great deal in common. Conventional MD simulations reveal that interfacial hydrophobic interactions contribute significantly to stabilize the tetramer. Interfacial residues including L17, V20, L110, and V121 with close contacts form a hydrophobic channel. Metadynamics simulations indicate that the mouth opening of the hydrophobic channel is the first and the most difficult step for dissociation. Interactions of V20 between opposing dimers lock four monomers into the tetramer, and disruption of the interactions is found to be involved in the final step. During the dissociation, an increasing extent of solvation was observed by calculating the radial distribution functions of water around interfacial hydrophobic residues, suggesting that water plays a role in driving the tetramer dissociation. Moreover, compared to T119, residue M119 has a longer side chain that extends into the hydrophobic channel, making solvation more difficult, consistent with a higher energy barrier for dissociation of the T119M tetramer. This result provides a good explanation for the protective role of the T119M mutation. Overall, this study can provide atomic-level insights to better understand the pathogenesis of TTR amyloidosis and guide rational drug design in the future.	1851.0
figshare	Charge Environment and Hydrogen Bond Dynamics in Binary Ionic Liquid Mixtures: A Computational Study	The extent of charge transfer between the cation and the anion in a room-temperature ionic liquid depends on the basicity of the anion. Ion charges determined in the condensed state via density functional theory calculations capture this effect rather well, and charges derived in such a manner have been employed in force field-based molecular dynamics simulations to quantitatively reproduce several physical properties of the liquids. However, the issue of transferability of cation charges in mixtures of ionic liquids, say with one type of cation and two different anion types needs to be addressed. Herein, we demonstrate that the cation charge in such a mixture varies linearly with anion composition, a result that ties in rather well with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic experiments. The variation in cation charge with bulk anion composition is shown to be a result of changes in its coordination environment. Cations surrounded by a higher proportion of more basic anions possess lower charges than those surrounded by less basic anions. Time scales for the exchange of anion types for the occupation of hydrogen bonding sites around the cation have been determined and are seen to be constituted by three processes–breakage of existing hydrogen bond, diffusion to the hydrogen bonding site and displacement of the incumbent anion from its site in the cation coordination shell. These time scales explain the differences observed between infrared and NMR spectroscopic experiments in ionic liquid mixtures rather well.	1631.0
figshare	Molecular Dynamics Simulation of the n‑Octacosane–Water Mixture Confined in Graphene Mesopores: Comparison of Atomistic and Coarse-Grained Calculations and the Effect of Catalyst Nanoparticle	Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is used extensively in the gas-to-liquids (GTL) process to produce clean, high-quality low emission transportation fuels from synthesis gas. In order to gain a better understanding of the phase behavior of the produced wax–water mixtures at reaction conditions by accounting for confinement effects of either hydrophilic or hydrophobic characteristics and catalyst nanoparticles (NPs), one needs to closely examine the validity of incorporating coarse grained approaches in the context of FTS. The present study focuses on simulating by means of atomistic (AA) and coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD; CGMD) simulations the n-octacosane (n-C28)–water mixture inside graphene (G) and graphene oxide (GO) mesopores under low-temperature FTS conditions (473.15 K) with the inclusion of a Co NP. Graphene derivatives were selected as they are emerging catalyst support materials in the FTS reaction and allow for direct comparisons between the AA and CG methodologies. We also evaluated the presence of long-chain alcohols such as dodecan-1-ol at 7 wt % on the n-C28–H2O mixture phase behavior. The AA simulations involved the use of the united atom TraPPE (TraPPE-UA) force field for n-C28 and the alcohols and the TIP4P/2005 force field for water, while the MARTINI force field was used for the CG description. With regard to the mixtures inside the G pore, both AA and CG simulation methods capture the phase separation of the mixture, with water molecules occupying the center of the pore and n-C28 forming layers at the pore walls; inside GO, both methodologies show that water separates near the surface and the model wax lies at the pore center. Both AA and CG simulations accurately capture the n-C28 and H2O diffusivity as a function of the distance from the G and GO pore centers, respectively, being lower closer to the pore surface. Dodecan-1-ol is mostly located at the n-C28–H2O interface showing a higher preference toward the wax as a consequence of increased van der Waals intermolecular interactions, slightly reducing the mobility of water. The agreement between AA and CG MD simulations paved the way for novel CGMD simulations with DFT-derived parameters for Co, to study the n-C28–H2O behavior in its presence. Our results show that the Co NP does not affect phase separation of the n-C28–H2O mixture inside the pores; however, water at such high concentrations covers the Co NP surface extensively. Given the experimental difficulties in exploring the relevant mechanisms at this scale, our results showcase that CGMD using the MARTINI force field can be employed to study FTS-related processes at this level and are expected to open new pathways in the investigation of confined mixtures relevant to the FTS reaction in the presence of supported catalyst NPs.	3009.0
figshare	Divalent Ion Parameterization Strongly Affects Conformation and Interactions of an Anionic Biomimetic Polymer	The description of peptides and the use of molecular dynamics simulations to refine structures and investigate the dynamics on an atomistic scale are well developed. Through a consensus in this community over multiple decades, parameters were developed for molecular interactions that only require the sequence of amino-acids and an initial guess for the three-dimensional structure. The recent discovery of peptoids will require a retooling of the currently available interaction potentials in order to have the same level of confidence in the predicted structures and pathways as there is presently in the peptide counterparts. Here we present modeling of peptoids using a combination of ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and atomistic resolution classical force field (FF) to span the relevant time and length scales. To properly account for the dominant forces that stabilize ordered structures of peptoids, namely steric-, electrostatic, and hydrophobic interactions mediated through side chain–side chain interactions in the FF model, those have to be first mapped out using high fidelity atomistic representations. A key feature here is not only to use gas phase quantum chemistry tools, but also account for solvation effects in the condensed phase through AIMD. One major challenge is to elucidate ion binding to charged or polar regions of the peptoid and its concomitant role in the creation of local order. Here, similar to proteins, a specific ion effect is observed suggesting that both the net charge and the precise chemical nature of the ion will need to be described.	1696.0
figshare	Investigation of a Pathway for Water Delivery in Photosystem II Protein by Molecular Dynamics Simulation	To understand the mechanism of the water-splitting reaction in photosynthesis, the dynamics of water molecules surrounding the oxygen evolution center (OEC) involving the Mn4O5Ca cluster in photosystem II (PSII) is investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. During the simulation, the surrounding interspace around the Mn4O5Ca cluster was filled with numerous water molecules. The traffic of water molecules in the bidirectional pathway between the Mn4O5Ca cluster and outside of PSII is investigated by analyzing MD trajectories. The result of this simulation suggests that water delivery to the Mn4O5Ca cluster in PSII is driven by self-diffusion of water molecules coupled with the synchronized motion of the residues surrounding the Mn4O5Ca cluster. By tracing these water molecules, we find that the water molecules predominantly take five water pathways to enter into and leave from PSII. In these pathways, the water molecules move being strongly affected by the structure and dynamics of PSII. Nevertheless, the directions of each water molecule in these pathways are nearly random. In contrast, the principal component analysis for Cα atoms in the PSII complex revealed that the residues surrounding the OEC showed the collective and continuing motion. In an attempt to assess the validity, the MD simulation of the D1-D61A mutant is performed, comparing the distribution of water molecules near the Mn4O5Ca cluster. The results show that the change in the water distribution by the D1-D61A mutant is responsible for the experimentally observed decrease in the activLity of PSII. The details of the pathways for water delivery provide important information about the water-splitting reaction.	1817.0
figshare	Molecular Simulations of CO2 and H2 Solubility, CO2 Diffusivity, and Solvent Viscosity at 298 K for 27 Commercially Available Physical Solvents	CO2 and H2 solubilities, CO2/H2 solubility selectivities, CO2 diffusivities, and solvent viscosities in 27 commercially available physical solvents at 298 K were calculated from molecular simulations using the CHARMM36 all-atom force field for most solvents, and the simulation results were compared with available experimental data. The van der Waals radius parameters for solvents were slightly tuned to reproduce the experimental solvent density. The simulated CO2 solubilities are comparable with the experimental data, with an average absolute difference of 28%. For the homologous compounds containing the −(OCH2CH2)– repeat unit, both simulated and experimental data show that CO2 solubility decreases when the number of repeat units is increased; CO2 solubilities in these homologous compounds exhibit almost a perfect positive linear correlation with the solvent free-volume fractions. The simulated H2 solubilities and CO2/H2 solubility selectivities are also comparable with the experimental data, with differences of 22% and 17%, respectively. The H2 solubilities in all solvents studied in this work correlate very well with the solvent free-volume fractions, exhibiting a positive linear correlation coefficient of 0.84. Additionally, simulations show that CO2 solubility decreases when the temperature is increased. In contrast, H2 solubility increases at elevated temperature, which is partly due to the increased solvent free-volume fraction at elevated temperature. Finally, although the viscosity difference tends to be large (30%–246%) between simulation and experiment, both simulated and experimental data exhibit a similar solvent viscosity trend. Furthermore, simulations show that CO2 diffusivities in solvents are very strongly correlated with the solvent viscosities and the relationship between them is given by DCO2 = (2.6 ± 0.3) × 10–9/ηsolvent0.59 ± 0.03.	2029.0

figshare	Patterning of Self-Assembled Monolayers of Amphiphilic Multisegment Ligands on Nanoparticles and Design Parameters for Protein Interactions	Functionalization of nanoparticles with specific ligands is helpful to control specific diagnostic and therapeutic responses such as protein adsorption, cell targeting, and circulation. Precision delivery critically depends on a fundamental understanding of the interplay between surface chemistry, ligand dynamics, and interaction with the biochemical environment. Due to limited atomic-scale insights into the structure and dynamics of nanoparticle-bound ligands from experiments, relationships of grafting density and ligand chemistry to observable properties such as hydrophilicity and protein interactions remain largely unknown. In this work, we uncover how self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) composed of multisegment ligands such as thioalkyl-PEG-(N-alkyl)­amides on gold nanoparticles can mimic mixed hydrophobic and hydrophilic ligand coatings, including control of patterns, hydrophilicity, and specific recognition properties. Our results are derived from molecular dynamics simulations with the INTERFACE-CHARMM36 force field at picometer resolution and comparisons to experiments. Small changes in ligand hydrophobicity, via adjusting the length of the N-terminal alkyl groups, tune water penetration by multiples and control superficial ordering of alkyl chains from 0 to 70% regularity. Further parameters include the grafting density of the ligands, curvature of the nanoparticle surfaces, type of solvent, and overall ligand length, which were examined in detail. We explain the thermodynamic origin of the formation of heterogeneous patterns of multisegment ligand SAMs and illustrate how different degrees of ligand order on the nanoparticle surface affect interactions with bovine serum albumin. The resulting design principles can be applied to a variety of ligand chemistries to customize the behavior of functionalized nanoparticles in biological media and enhance therapeutic efficiency.	2048.0
figshare	Conserved Water Networks Identification for Drug Design Using Density Clustering Approaches on Positional and Orientational Data	This work describes the development and testing of a method for the identification and classification of conserved water molecules and their networks from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The conserved waters in the active sites of proteins influence protein–ligand binding. Recently, several groups have argued that a water network formed from conserved waters can be used to interpret the thermodynamic signature of the binding site. We implemented a novel methodology in which we apply the complex approach to categorize water molecules extracted from the MD simulation trajectories using clustering approaches. The main advantage of our methodology as compared to current state of the art approaches is the inclusion of the information on the orientation of hydrogen atoms to further inform the clustering algorithm and to classify the conserved waters into different subtypes depending on how strongly certain orientations are preferred. This information is vital for assessing the stability of water networks. The newly developed approach is described in detail as well as validated against known results from the scientific literature including comparisons with the experimental data on thermolysin, thrombin, and Haemophilus influenzae virulence protein SiaP as well as with the previous computational results on thermolysin. We observed excellent agreement with the literature and were also able to provide additional insights into the orientations of the conserved water molecules, highlighting the key interactions which stabilize them. The source code of our approach, as well as the utility tools used for visualization, are freely available on GitHub.	1797.0
figshare	Accuracy Comparison of Generalized Born Models in the Calculation of Electrostatic Binding Free Energies	The need for accurate yet efficient representation of the aqueous environment in biomolecular modeling has led to the development of a variety of generalized Born (GB) implicit solvent models. While many studies have focused on the accuracy of available GB models in predicting solvation free energies, a systematic assessment of the quality of these models in binding free energy calculations, crucial for rational drug design, has not been undertaken. Here, we evaluate the accuracies of eight common GB flavors (GB-HCT, GB-OBC, GB-neck2, GBNSR6, GBSW, GBMV1, GBMV2, and GBMV3), available in major molecular dynamics packages, in predicting the electrostatic binding free energies (ΔΔGel) for a diverse set of 60 biomolecular complexes belonging to four main classes: protein–protein, protein-drug, RNA-peptide, and small complexes. The GB flavors are examined in terms of their ability to reproduce the results from the Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) model, commonly used as accuracy reference in this context. We show that the agreement with the PB of ΔΔGel estimates varies widely between different GB models and also across different types of biomolecular complexes, with R2 correlations ranging from 0.3772 to 0.9986. A surface-based “R6” GB model recently implemented in AMBER shows the closest overall agreement with reference PB (R2 = 0.9949, RMSD = 8.75 kcal/mol). The RNA-peptide and protein-drug complex sets appear to be most challenging for all but one model, as indicated by the large deviations from the PB in ΔΔGel. Small neutral complexes present the least challenge for most of the GB models tested. The quantitative demonstration of the strengths and weaknesses of the GB models across the diverse complex types provided here can be used as a guide for practical computations and future development efforts.	1924.0
figshare	The Protein’s Role in Substrate Positioning and Reactivity for Biosynthetic Enzyme Complexes: The Case of SyrB2/SyrB1	Biosynthetic enzyme complexes selectively catalyze challenging chemical transformations, including alkane functionalization (e.g., halogenation of threonine, Thr, by the non-heme iron halogenase SyrB2). However, the role of complex formation in enabling reactivity and guiding selectivity is poorly understood, owing to the challenges associated with obtaining detailed structural information on the dynamically associating protein complexes. Combining over 10 μs of classical molecular dynamics of SyrB2 and the acyl carrier protein SyrB1 with large-scale QM/MM simulation, we investigate the substrate–protein and protein–protein dynamics that give rise to experimentally observed substrate positioning and reactivity trends. We confirm the presence of a hypothesized substrate-delivery channel in SyrB2 through free energy simulations that show channel opening with a low free energy barrier. We identify stabilizing interactions at the SyrB2/SyrB1 interface that are compatible with phosphopantetheine (PPant) delivery of substrate to SyrB2. By sampling metal–substrate distances observed in experimental spectroscopy of native SyrB2/SyrB1-PPant-S-Thr and non-native substrates, we characterize essential protein–substrate interactions that are responsible for substrate positioning, and thus, reactivity. We observe the hydroxyl side chain and terminal amine of the native Thr substrate to form cooperative hydrogen bonds with a single N123 residue in SyrB2. In comparison, non-native substrates that lack the hydroxyl interact more flexibly with the protein and therefore can orient closer to the Fe center, explaining their preferential hydroxylation.	1775.0
figshare	Atomistic Simulations of the Mechanisms of the Poorly Catalytic Mitochondrial Chaperone Trap1: Insights into the Effects of Structural Asymmetry on Reactivity	The mitochondrial chaperone Trap1 is an ATPase protein that oversees the correct folding of client proteins and exhibits altered activity and/or expression levels in certain cancers. By inducing extensive structural rearrangements, ATP cleavage is essential for Trap1 to fulfill its task; at the same time, Trap1’s sluggish ATP turnover represents one of the control switches through which its conformational cycle and inter-residue cross-talk signals mediating it can be subtly tuned. Remarkably, hydrolysis requires Trap1 to adopt a distinctive asymmetric “closed” homodimeric conformation wherein the ATP bound to the “buckled” protomer (Buc) is preferentially cleaved, while hydrolysis in the “straight” protomer (Str) remains unfavored. However, molecular links between asymmetry and Trap1’s characteristic reactivity remain elusive, due to intrinsic mechanistic complexity and its protomers’ active site similarity. To address this issue, we herein report a detailed computational investigation of Trap1’s potential ATPase mechanisms. Through classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations we monitor how frequently ATP and nucleophilic water WatNuc can attain reactive poses within Buc and Str. Semiempirical hybrid quantum mechanical–molecular mechanical (QM/MM) MD simulations coupled to umbrella sampling and benchmarked with density functional theory calculations are then used to sample reaction free energy barriers within each protomer for two possible hydrolytic pathways. Enzyme-assisted hydrolysis, featuring a metaphosphate-like transition state and a catalytic glutamate deprotonating WatNuc, is found to be favored in both protomers over substrate-assisted hydrolysis. However, we also find that WatNuc’s sequestration by another water molecule WatTyr bound to a vicinal tyrosine is far rarer in Buc, proving that such a rare sequestration lowers reaction barriers for the enzyme-assisted pathway. We thus identify the (biologically significant) tyrosine as the main mediator favoring ATP hydrolysis in Buc over Str. Our improved model for Trap1 reactivity is experimentally and structurally consistent and should further aid in the development of selective modulators of the protein’s activities.	2374.0
figshare	Molecular modelling of HPV E6 protein reveal new potential inhibitors against high-risk Human Papillomavirus: Supporting Information	Abstract: High-risk strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) have been identified as the etiologic agent of some anogenital tract, head, and neck cancers. Although prophylactic HPV vaccines have been approved; it is still necessary a drug-based treatment against the infection and its oncogenic effects. The E6 oncoprotein is one of the most studied therapeutic targets of HPV, it has been identified as a key factor in cell immortalization and tumor progression in HPV-positive cells. E6 can promote the degradation of p53, a tumor suppressor protein, through the interaction with the cellular ubiquitin ligase E6AP. Therefore, preventing the formation of the E6-E6AP complex is one of the main strategies to inhibit the viability and proliferation of infected cells. Herein, we propose an in silico pipeline to identify small-molecule inhibitors of the E6-E6AP interaction. Virtual screening was carried out by predicting the ADME properties of the molecules and performing ensemble-based docking simulations to E6 protein followed by binding free energy estimation through MM/PB(GB)SA methods. Finally, the top-three compounds were selected, and their stability in the E6 docked complex and their effect in the inhibition of the E6-E6AP interaction was corroborated by molecular dynamics simulation. Therefore, this pipeline and the identified molecules represent a new starting point in the development of anti-HPV drugs.This fileset contains raw data from molecular dynamics simulations of HPV-16 E6 protein, including initial files and backbone trajectories. Also includes the initial compound library, ADME properties predictions, molecular docking results and hit compounds in mol2 format.	1826.0
figshare	Taming Rugged Free Energy Landscapes Using an Average Force	ConspectusThe observation of complex structural transitions in biological and abiological molecular objects within time scales amenable to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is often hampered by significant free energy barriers associated with entangled movements. Importance-sampling algorithms, a powerful class of numerical schemes for the investigation of rare events, have been widely used to extend simulations beyond the time scale common to MD. However, probing processes spanning milliseconds through microsecond molecular simulations still constitutes in practice a daunting challenge because of the difficulty of taming the ruggedness of multidimensional free energy surfaces by means of naive transition coordinates. To address this limitation, in recent years we have elaborated importance-sampling methods relying on an adaptive biasing force (ABF). In this Account, we review recent developments of algorithms aimed at mapping rugged free energy landscapes that correspond to complex processes of physical, chemical, and biological relevance. Through these developments, we have broadened the spectrum of applications of the popular ABF algorithm while improving its computational efficiency, notably for multidimensional free energy calculations. One major algorithmic advance, coined meta-eABF, merges the key features of metadynamics and an extended Lagrangian variant of ABF (eABF) by simultaneously shaving the barriers and flooding the valleys of the free energy landscape, and it possesses a convergence rate up to 5-fold greater than those of other importance-sampling algorithms. Through faster convergence and enhanced ergodic properties, meta-eABF represents a significant step forward in the simulation of millisecond-time-scale events. Here we introduce extensions of the algorithm, notably its well-tempered and replica-exchange variants, which further boost the sampling efficiency while gaining in numerical stability, thus allowing quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical free energy calculations to be performed at a lower cost. As a paradigm to bridge microsecond simulations to millisecond events by means of free energy calculations, we have applied the ABF family of algorithms to decompose complex movements in molecular objects of biological and abiological nature. We show here how water lubricates the shuttling of an amide-based rotaxane by altering the mechanism that underlies the concerted translation and isomerization of the macrocycle. Introducing novel collective variables in a computational workflow for the rigorous determination of standard binding free energies, we predict with utmost accuracy the thermodynamics of protein–ligand reversible association. Because of their simplicity, versatility, and robust mathematical foundations, the algorithms of the ABF family represent an appealing option for the theoretical investigation of a broad range of problems relevant to physics, chemistry, and biology.	3019.0
figshare	Nanoscale Relaxation in “Water-in-Salt” and “Water-in-Bisalt” Electrolytes	“Water-in-salt” (WIS) and “water-in-bisalt” (WIBS) electrolytes have recently been developed for Li-ion batteries, combining the safety and environmental friendliness of aqueous electrolytes with a larger operating window made possible by a solid-electrolyte interphase. We report quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements on solutions of a WIS electrolyte at two concentrations, 13.9 and 21 m (molal) lithium bis­(trifluoromethane)­sulfonimide LiTFSI in H2O/D2O and a WIBS electrolyte at (21 m LiTFSI + 7 m lithium triflate (LiOTf)) in H2O/D2O. The data were Fourier transformed to obtain experimental intermediate scattering functions (ISFs) and compared with corresponding quantities obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Both QENS and MD ISFs could be fitted well by a single stretched exponential function to obtain apparent translational diffusion coefficients for the water molecules. The QENS values agree well with the MD simulations for the 13.9 and 21 m solutions, but MD simulations predict a slower relaxation of water compared to QENS for the WIBS electrolyte. Comparison of the incoherent and coherent scattering reveals much faster water dynamics compared with structural relaxation of the ionic framework, consistent with the nanodomain picture where the lithium diffusion occurs through the tortuous water domain around the slower relaxing ionic matrix, leading to highly non-Gaussian water motion.	1513.0
figshare	Molecular Dynamics-Derived Descriptor Informs the Impact of Mutation on the Catalytic Turnover Number in Lactonase Across Substrates	Molecular dynamics simulations have been extensively employed to reveal the roles of protein dynamics in mediating enzyme catalysis. However, simulation-derived predictive descriptors that inform the impacts of mutations on catalytic turnover numbers remain largely unexplored. In this work, we report the identification of molecular modeling-derived descriptors to predict mutation effect on the turnover number of lactonase SsoPox with both native and non-native substrates. The study consists of 10 enzyme–substrate complexes resulting from a combination of five enzyme variants with two substrates. For each complex, we derived 15 descriptors from molecular dynamics simulations and applied principal component analysis to rank the predictive capability of the descriptors. A top-ranked descriptor was identified, which is the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) ratio of the substrate to the active site pocket. A uniform volcano-shaped plot was observed in the distribution of experimental activation free energy against the SASA ratio. To achieve efficient lactonase hydrolysis, a non-native substrate-bound enzyme variant needs to involve a similar range of the SASA ratio to the native substrate-bound wild-type enzyme. The descriptor reflects how well the enzyme active site pocket accommodates a substrate for reaction, which has the potential of guiding optimization of enzyme reaction turnover for non-native chemical transformations.	1582.0
figshare	TopoGromacs: Automated Topology Conversion from CHARMM to GROMACS within VMD	Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation engines use a variety of different approaches for modeling molecular systems with force fields that govern their dynamics and describe their topology. These different approaches introduce incompatibilities between engines, and previously published software bridges the gaps between many popular MD packages, such as between CHARMM and AMBER or GROMACS and LAMMPS. While there are many structure building tools available that generate topologies and structures in CHARMM format, only recently have mechanisms been developed to convert their results into GROMACS input. We present an approach to convert CHARMM-formatted topology and parameters into a format suitable for simulation with GROMACS by expanding the functionality of TopoTools, a plugin integrated within the widely used molecular visualization and analysis software VMD. The conversion process was diligently tested on a comprehensive set of biological molecules in vacuo. The resulting comparison between energy terms shows that the translation performed was lossless as the energies were unchanged for identical starting configurations. By applying the conversion process to conventional benchmark systems that mimic typical modestly sized MD systems, we explore the effect of the implementation choices made in CHARMM, NAMD, and GROMACS. The newly available automatic conversion capability breaks down barriers between simulation tools and user communities and allows users to easily compare simulation programs and leverage their unique features without the tedium of constructing a topology twice.	1675.0

figshare	Using NMR Chemical Shifts and Cryo-EM Density Restraints in Iterative Rosetta-MD Protein Structure Refinement	Cryo-EM has become one of the prime methods for protein structure elucidation, frequently yielding density maps with near-atomic or medium resolution. If protein structures cannot be deduced unambiguously from the density maps, computational structure refinement tools are needed to generate protein structural models. We have previously developed an iterative Rosetta-MDFF protocol that used cryo-EM densities to refine protein structures. Here we show that, in addition to cryo-EM densities, incorporation of other experimental restraints into the Rosetta-MDFF protocol further improved refined structures. We used NMR chemical shift (CS) data integrated with cryo-EM densities in our hybrid protocol in both the Rosetta step and the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations step. In 15 out of 18 cases for all MD rounds, the refinement results obtained when density maps and NMR chemical shift data were used in combination outperformed those of density map-only refinement. Notably, the improvement in refinement was highest when medium and low-resolution density maps were used. With our hybrid method, the RMSDs of final models obtained were always better than the RMSDs obtained by our previous protocol with just density refinement for both medium (6.9 Å) and low (9 Å) resolution maps. For all the six test proteins with medium resolution density maps (6.9 Å), the final refined structure RMSDs were lower for the hybrid method than for the cryo-EM only refinement. The final refined RMSDs were less than 1.5 Å when our hybrid protocol was used with 4 Å density maps. For four out of the six proteins the final RMSDs were even less than 1 Å. This study demonstrates that by using a combination of cryo-EM and NMR restraints, it is possible to refine structures to atomic resolution, outperforming single restraint refinement. This hybrid protocol will be a valuable tool when only low-resolution cryo-EM density data and NMR chemical shift data are available to refine structures.	2093.0
figshare	Acceptance and Kinetic Resolution of α-Methyl-Substituted Aldehydes by Norcoclaurine Synthases	Norcoclaurine synthase (NCS) catalyzes a stereoselective Pictet–Spengler reaction to give the key intermediate, (S)-norcoclaurine in benzylisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis. This family of alkaloids contains many bioactive molecules including morphine and berberine. Recently, NCS has been demonstrated to accept a variety of aldehydes and some ketones as substrates, leading to a range of chiral tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) products. Here, we report the unusual acceptance of α-substituted aldehydes, in particular α-methyl-substituted aldehydes, by wild-type Thalictrum flavum NCS (Δ33TfNCS) to give THIQ products. Moreover, the kinetic resolution of several α-substituted aldehydes to give THIQs with two defined chiral centers in a single step with high conversions was achieved. Several dopamine analogues were also accepted as substrates, and reactions were amenable to scale up. Active site mutants of TfNCS were then used, which demonstrated the potential to enhance the stereoselectivities in the reaction and improve yields. The rationale for the acceptance of these substrates and improved activity with different mutants has been gained from a co-crystallized structure of Δ33TfNCS with a nonproductive mimic of a reaction intermediate bound in the active site. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to study the binding of dopamine and an α-substituted aldehyde and provided further insight into the reaction with these substrates.	1558.0
figshare	The Impact of Using Single Atomistic Long-Range Cutoff Schemes with the GROMOS 54A7 Force Field	With the recent increase in computing power, the molecular modeling community is now more focused on improving the accuracy and overall quality of biomolecular simulations. For the available simulation packages, force fields, and all other associated methods used, this relates to how well they describe the conformational space and thermodynamic properties of a biomolecular system. The parameter sets of GROMOS force fields have been parametrized and validated with the reaction field (RF) method using charge groups and a twin-range cutoff scheme (0.8/1.4 nm). However, the most recent versions of GROMACS (since v.2016) discontinued the support for charge groups. To take full advantage of the newer and faster versions of this software package with GROMOS 54A7 and RF, we need to evaluate the impact of using a single cutoff scheme (vs twin-range) and of using the Verlet list update method (which is atomistic) compared to the group-based cutoff scheme. Our results show that the GROMOS 54A7 force field seems consistent with a single cutoff, since the resulting conformation and protonation ensembles were indistinguishable. The GROMOS parametrization procedure was also reproduced using an atomistic cutoff scheme, and we have observed that the hydration free energy values of small amino acid side-chain analogues were similar to the ones obtained with the group-based protocol. We do observe a small impact of the atomistic cutoff scheme in the conformational space of the model systems studied (G1-PAMAM and DMPC). However, since the structural properties of these systems are well converged for the cutoff range used (1.4–2.0 nm), unlike with the group-based cutoff schemes, we are confident that the atomistic cutoff can be adopted with RF for MD and constant-pH MD biomolecular simulations using the GROMOS 54A7 force field.	1933.0
figshare	Are Protein Force Fields Getting Better? A Systematic Benchmark on 524 Diverse NMR Measurements	Recent hardware and software advances have enabled simulation studies of protein systems on biophysically relevant time scales, often revealing the need for improved force fields. Although early force field development was limited by the lack of direct comparisons between simulation and experiment, recent work from several laboratories has demonstrated direct calculation of NMR observables from protein simulations. Here, we quantitatively evaluate 11 recent molecular dynamics force fields in combination with 5 solvent models against a suite of 524 chemical shift and J coupling (3JHNHα, 3JHNCβ, 3JHαC′, 3JHNC′, and 3JHαN) measurements on dipeptides, tripeptides, tetra-alanine, and ubiquitin. Of the force fields examined (ff96, ff99, ff03, ff03*, ff03w, ff99sb*, ff99sb-ildn, ff99sb-ildn-phi, ff99sb-ildn-NMR, CHARMM27, and OPLS-AA), two force fields (ff99sb-ildn-phi, ff99sb-ildn-NMR) combining recent side chain and backbone torsion modifications achieved high accuracy in our benchmark. For the two optimal force fields, the calculation error is comparable to the uncertainty in the experimental comparison. This observation suggests that extracting additional force field improvements from NMR data may require increased accuracy in J coupling and chemical shift prediction. To further investigate the limitations of current force fields, we also consider conformational populations of dipeptides, which were recently estimated using vibrational spectroscopy.	1565.0
figshare	An Active Site Inhibitor Induces Conformational Penalties for ACE2 Recognition by the Spike Protein of SARS-CoV‑2	The novel RNA virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus II (SARS-CoV-2), is currently the leading cause of mortality in 2020, having led to over 1.6 million deaths and infecting over 75 million people worldwide by December 2020. While vaccination has started and several clinical trials for a number of vaccines are currently underway, there is a pressing need for a cure for those already infected with the virus. Of particular interest in the design of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics is the human protein angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) to which this virus adheres before entry into the host cell. The SARS-CoV-2 virion binds to cell-surface bound ACE2 via interactions of the spike protein (s-protein) on the viral surface with ACE2. In this paper, we use all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and binding enthalpy calculations to determine the effect that a bound ACE2 active site inhibitor (MLN-4760) would have on the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 s-protein with ACE2. Our analysis indicates that the binding enthalpy could be reduced for s-protein adherence to the active site inhibitor-bound ACE2 protein by as much as 1.48-fold as an upper limit. This weakening of binding strength was observed to be due to the destabilization of the interactions between ACE2 residues Glu-35, Glu-37, Tyr-83, Lys-353, and Arg-393 and the SARS-CoV-2 s-protein receptor binding domain (RBD). The conformational changes were shown to lead to weakening of ACE2 interactions with SARS-CoV-2 s-protein, therefore reducing s-protein binding strength. Further, we observed increased conformational lability of the N-terminal helix and a conformational shift of a significant portion of the ACE2 motifs involved in s-protein binding, which may affect the kinetics of the s-protein binding when the small molecule inhibitor is bound to the ACE2 active site. These observations suggest potential new ways for interfering with the SARS-CoV-2 adhesion by modulating ACE2 conformation through distal active site inhibitor binding.	2143.0
figshare	Insight into the Dual Inhibition Mechanism of Corilagin against MRSA Serine/Threonine Phosphatase (Stp1) by Molecular Modeling	Serine/threonine phosphatase (Stp1) is known to be involved in the regulation of cysteine phosphorylation levels in many different pathways, such as virulence factor regulation in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Therefore, Stp1 can be used as a potential target for inhibiting MRSA infection. In this study, using virtual screening, we found that corilagin, a natural compound, was screened as a potential Stp1 inhibitor. Then, the phosphatase assay exhibited high inhibitory activity against Stp1. On the basis of the enzyme kinetics experiment, we found that corilagin exhibited a dual inhibitory mechanism of competitive and allosteric inhibition. To further elucidate the mechanism of interaction between corilagin and Stp1, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on the Stp1–corilagin complex. Consistent with the mutagenesis assays and fluorescence quenching assays results, the competitive and allosteric binding sites of corilagin with Stp1 were identified. In the competitive binding site of Stp1, Asn162, Ile164, Tyr199, and Lys232 were found to play a key role in this complex. In the allosteric binding site, hydrophobic interaction was the main binding force. The Asn142, Val145, Leu146, Pro152, and Phe179 residues of Stp1 were found to play a critical role in the binding of corilagin with Stp1. In this study, we used MD simulation to reveal the ligand–protein interactions, providing a theoretical basis. This research work, thus, lays down the foundation for the development of new Stp1 inhibitors to be utilized in the future.	1703.0
figshare	A Comparison of Methods for Computing Relative Anhydrous–Hydrate Stability with Molecular Simulation	The transformation of a pharmaceutical solid from an anhydrous crystal into a hydrated form during drug development represents a risk to a product’s safety and efficacy due to the potential impact on stability, bioavailability, and manufacturability. In this work, we examine 10 classical free energy simulation protocols to evaluate the thermodynamic stability of hydrated crystals relative to their anhydrous forms. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to compute the Gibbs free energies of the crystals of three pharmaceutically relevant systems using two fixed-charge potentials, GAFF and OPLS, as well as the polarizable AMOEBA model. In addition, we explore a variety of water models, including TIP3P, TIP4P, and AMOEBA, for both the interstitial water and the effects of ambient humidity. The AMOEBA model predicts free energy values most consistent with experimental measurements among the models examined. The benefits of a fully polarizable water model relative to fixed-charged models appear to derive predominantly from a better treatment of water’s dipole moment in the crystalline phase. Despite this improved physical treatment, we find that no single model produces reliable predictions of the phase boundary between hydrated and anhydrous crystals from theory alone. However, we show that accurate phase diagrams can be constructed from the simulations by introducing a single experimentally determined coexistence point. With this single experimental data point as input, the phase boundary is correctly predicted within 10% relative humidity on the temperature range of 15 to 75 °C for all three systems examined. Furthermore, we demonstrate that with this known coexistence point as an input, the differences between the various potentials and the water models become insignificant, as all models yield accurate phase boundaries regardless of whether polarization is included due to significant temperature-dependent error cancellation between models.	2074.0
figshare	Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Threadlike Cetyltrimethylammonium Chloride Micelles: Effects of Sodium Chloride and Sodium Salicylate Salts	We use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to probe the effects of added sodium chloride (NaCl) and sodium salicylate (NaSal) salts on the spherical-to-threadlike micelle shape transition in aqueous solutions of cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) surfactants. Long threadlike micelles are found to be unstable and break into spherical micelles at low concentrations of NaCl, but remain stable for 20 ns above a threshold value of [NaCl] ≈ 3.0 M, which is about 2.5 times larger than the experimental salt concentration at which the transition between spherical and rodlike micelles occurs. The chloride counterions associate weakly on the surface of the CTAC micelles with the degree of counterion dissociation decreasing slightly with increasing [NaCl] on spherical micelles, but dropping significantly on the threadlike micelles at high [NaCl]. This effect indicates that the electrolyte ions drive the micellar shape transition by screening the electrostatic repulsions between the micellar headgroups. The aromatic salicylate counterions, on the other hand, penetrate inside the micelle with their hydrophilic groups staying in the surfactant headgroup region and the hydrophobic groups partially embedded into the hydrophobic core of the micelle. The strong association of the salicylate ions with the surfactant headgroups leads to dense packing of the surfactant molecules, which effectively reduces the surface area per surfactant, and increases intramicellar ordering of the surfactant headgroups, favoring the formation of long threadlike micelles. Simulation predictions of the geometric and electrostatic properties of the spherical and threadlike micelles are in good agreement with experiments.	1858.0
figshare	A New Lipid Force Field (FUJI)	To explore inhomogeneous and anisotropic systems such as lipid bilayers, the Lennard-Jones particle mesh Ewald (LJ-PME) method has been applied without a conventional isotropic dispersion correction. As the popular AMBER and CHARMM lipid force fields were developed using a cutoff scheme, their lipid bilayers unacceptably shrink when using the LJ-PME method. In this study, a new all-atom lipid force field (FUJI) was developed on the basis of the AMBER force-field scheme including the Lipid14 van der Waals parameters. Point charges were calculated using the restrained electrostatic potentials of many lipid conformers. Further, torsion energy profiles were calculated using high-level ab initio molecular orbitals (LCCSD­(T)/Aug-cc-pVTZ//LMP2/Aug-cc-pVTZ), following which the molecular mechanical dihedral parameters were derived through a fast Fourier transform. By incorporation of these parameters into a new lipid force field without fitting experimental data, the desired lipid characteristics such as the area per lipid and lateral diffusion coefficients were obtained through GROMACS molecular dynamics simulations using the LJ-PME method and virtual hydrogen sites. The calculated area per lipid and lateral diffusion coefficients showed satisfactory agreement with experimental data. Furthermore, the electron-density profiles along the membrane normal were calculated for pure lipid bilayers, and the resulting membrane thicknesses agreed well with the experimental values. As the new lipid force field is compatible with FUJI for protein and small molecules, the new FUJI force field will offer accurate modeling for complex systems consisting of various membrane proteins and lipids.	1731.0
figshare	Predictions of Ligand Selectivity from Absolute Binding Free Energy Calculations	Binding selectivity is a requirement for the development of a safe drug, and it is a critical property for chemical probes used in preclinical target validation. Engineering selectivity adds considerable complexity to the rational design of new drugs, as it involves the optimization of multiple binding affinities. Computationally, the prediction of binding selectivity is a challenge, and generally applicable methodologies are still not available to the computational and medicinal chemistry communities. Absolute binding free energy calculations based on alchemical pathways provide a rigorous framework for affinity predictions and could thus offer a general approach to the problem. We evaluated the performance of free energy calculations based on molecular dynamics for the prediction of selectivity by estimating the affinity profile of three bromodomain inhibitors across multiple bromodomain families, and by comparing the results to isothermal titration calorimetry data. Two case studies were considered. In the first one, the affinities of two similar ligands for seven bromodomains were calculated and returned excellent agreement with experiment (mean unsigned error of 0.81 kcal/mol and Pearson correlation of 0.75). In this test case, we also show how the preferred binding orientation of a ligand for different proteins can be estimated via free energy calculations. In the second case, the affinities of a broad-spectrum inhibitor for 22 bromodomains were calculated and returned a more modest accuracy (mean unsigned error of 1.76 kcal/mol and Pearson correlation of 0.48); however, the reparametrization of a sulfonamide moiety improved the agreement with experiment.	1769.0
figshare	Prediction of Alkanolamine pKa Values by Combined Molecular Dynamics Free Energy Simulations and ab Initio Calculations	Knowledge of aqueous protonation constants (pKa) of chemical species is of significant importance in CO2 reactive absorption system design. Their theoretical prediction has mainly relied on implicit solvent models, and the performance of explicit solvent simulations based on classical force fields have rarely been studied. In this paper, we report the results of simulations in explicit TIP3P water with the General Amber Force Field (GAFF) and with the SMD continuum solvent method for the deprotonation pKa values of 29 conformationally diverse alkanolamine species commonly used in CO2 capture. In both cases, we employ the Tissandier value for the hydration free energy of the proton (“The proton’s absolute aqueous enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of solvation from cluster–ion solvation data”, Tissandier, M.D. et al., J. Phys. Chem. A, 1998, 102, 7787–7794). The ideal–gas reaction free energies and their uncertainties were obtained from electronic structure calculations using five different compound methods (CBS-QB3, CBS-APNO, G3, G3B3, G4). The hydration free energies of the neutral and protonated forms of the alkanolamines were calculated using the semiempirical AM1-BCC charge method, in addition to several partial atomic charge sets based on the RESP fitting method using electrostatic potentials computed at different ab initio theory/levels in the gas phase as well as in the presence of the solvent reaction field. We incorporated the Galvani surface potential of the ions in the (pKa) calculations. Although the individual species hydration free energies show significant sensitivity to the charge model, the resulting pKa values from different charge models are quite similar. Moreover, we found that the protonated amine hydration free energies show slightly less sensitivity to the partial charge method than in the case of the neutral amine. While the predicted pKa values based on the RESP charges yield reasonable agreement with the experimental data, they are prone to occasional disagreement for molecules of complex geometry. The best performance was achieved using the semiempirical AM1-BCC charges, which showed a mean absolute error of less than 0.73 pKa units in comparison with experimental data. Our results suggest that the AM1-BCC charge method may be used to model electrolyte solutions encountered in the CO2 reactive absorption process.	2497.0
figshare	Allosteric Boost by TAB1 on the TAK1 Kinase Favorably Sculpts the Thermodynamic Landscape of Activation	The intricate mechanisms of allosteric regulation in kinases are of general interest to the scientific community for potential therapeutic implications. However, the diversity among kinases and their regulatory routes requires a case-by-case study to widen the repertoire of known mechanisms. The present study achieves this by understanding TAK1 kinase activation by TAB1 as a model phenomenon for the first time. Despite the known capacity of TAK1 to switch between its inactive (“DFG-out”) and active-like (“DFG-in”) conformations, the questionable role of TAB1 in offering an energetic favor to this has been addressed here using sequential combination of enhanced sampling methods like targeted molecular dynamics (TMD) and Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD). It reveals how a minimal domain of TAB1 sufficiently acts like a “catalytic gear” by favorably sculpting TAK1’s thermodynamic landscape (potential of mean force in 2D) that accelerates “in”–“out” conformational switching of the conserved DFG motif. Standard molecular dynamics simulations (∼5 μs) reveal that TAB1 fascinatingly exploits the “lever-like” αF helix of TAK1 kinase domain to remotely propel the DFG motif via subtle helical “unfolding–folding” modifications within the kinase activation loop. The presence of two charged residues on terminal poles of αF helix imparts it, with this unique “lever-like” utility, and this turns out to be one important signature of co-evolution between TAK1 and TAB1. The entire mechanism of TAB1’s impact transduction, which is found to be analogous to the moves in the popular “Chinese checker” game, gives a clear proof of the “dynamics-driven allostery” concept in kinases. The findings further benchmark TAK1’s known autophosphorylation capacity. A novel insight into kinase allostery is thus provided, which potentiates investigation of similar capacities in other kinases.	2003.0

figshare	Structural and dynamic basis of substrate permissiveness in hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT)	Substrate permissiveness has long been regarded as the raw materials for the evolution of new enzymatic functions. In land plants, hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT) is an essential enzyme of the phenylpropanoid metabolism. Although essential enzymes are normally associated with high substrate specificity, HCT can utilize a variety of non-native substrates. To examine the structural and dynamic basis of substrate permissiveness in this enzyme, we report the crystal structure of HCT from Selaginella moellendorffii and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed on five orthologous HCTs from several major lineages of land plants. Through altogether 17-μs MD simulations, we demonstrate the prevalent swing motion of an arginine handle on a submicrosecond timescale across all five HCTs, which plays a key role in native substrate recognition by these intrinsically promiscuous enzymes. Our simulations further reveal how a non-native substrate of HCT engages a binding site different from that of the native substrate and diffuses to reach the catalytic center and its co-substrate. By numerically solving the Smoluchowski equation, we show that the presence of such an alternative binding site, even when it is distant from the catalytic center, always increases the reaction rate of a given substrate. However, this increase is only significant for enzyme-substrate reactions heavily influenced by diffusion. In these cases, binding non-native substrates ‘off-center’ provides an effective rationale to develop substrate permissiveness while maintaining the native functions of promiscuous enzymes.	1700.0
figshare	Enhancing Side Chain Rotamer Sampling Using Nonequilibrium Candidate Monte Carlo	Molecular simulations are a valuable tool for studying biomolecular motions and thermodynamics. However, such motions can be slow compared to simulation time scales, yet critical. Specifically, adequate sampling of side chain motions in protein binding pockets is crucial for obtaining accurate estimates of ligand binding free energies from molecular simulations. The time scale of side chain rotamer flips can range from a few ps to several hundred ns or longer, particularly in crowded environments like the interior of proteins. Here, we apply a mixed nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC)/molecular dynamics (MD) method to enhance sampling of side chain rotamers. The NCMC portion of our method applies a switching protocol wherein the steric and electrostatic interactions between target side chain atoms and the surrounding environment are cycled off and then back on during the course of a move proposal. Between NCMC move proposals, simulation of the system continues via traditional molecular dynamics. Here, we first validate this approach on a simple, solvated valine-alanine dipeptide system and then apply it to a well-studied model ligand binding site in T4 lysozyme L99A. We compute the rate of rotamer transitions for a valine side chain using our approach and compare it to that of traditional molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we show that our NCMC/MD method substantially enhances side chain sampling, especially in systems where the torsional barrier to rotation is high (≥10 kcal/mol). These barriers can be intrinsic torsional barriers or steric barriers imposed by the environment. Overall, this may provide a promising strategy to selectively improve side chain sampling in molecular simulations.	1811.0
figshare	Beyond Shielding: The Roles of Glycans in the SARS-CoV‑2 Spike Protein	The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in more than 28,000,000 infections and 900,000 deaths worldwide to date. Antibody development efforts mainly revolve around the extensively glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, which mediates host cell entry by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Similar to many other viral fusion proteins, the SARS-CoV-2 spike utilizes a glycan shield to thwart the host immune response. Here, we built a full-length model of the glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 S protein, both in the open and closed states, augmenting the available structural and biological data. Multiple microsecond-long, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were used to provide an atomistic perspective on the roles of glycans and on the protein structure and dynamics. We reveal an essential structural role of N-glycans at sites N165 and N234 in modulating the conformational dynamics of the spike’s receptor binding domain (RBD), which is responsible for ACE2 recognition. This finding is corroborated by biolayer interferometry experiments, which show that deletion of these glycans through N165A and N234A mutations significantly reduces binding to ACE2 as a result of the RBD conformational shift toward the “down” state. Additionally, end-to-end accessibility analyses outline a complete overview of the vulnerabilities of the glycan shield of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which may be exploited in the therapeutic efforts targeting this molecular machine. Overall, this work presents hitherto unseen functional and structural insights into the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and its glycan coat, providing a strategy to control the conformational plasticity of the RBD that could be harnessed for vaccine development.	1875.0
figshare	Kinetic Models of Cyclosporin A in Polar and Apolar Environments Reveal Multiple Congruent Conformational States	The membrane permeability of cyclic peptides and peptidomimetics, which are generally larger and more complex than typical drug molecules, is likely strongly influenced by the conformational behavior of these compounds in polar and apolar environments. The size and complexity of peptides often limit their bioavailability, but there are known examples of peptide natural products such as cyclosporin A (CsA) that can cross cell membranes by passive diffusion. CsA is an undecapeptide with seven methylated backbone amides. Its crystal structure shows a “closed” twisted β-pleated sheet conformation with four intramolecular hydrogen bonds that is also observed in NMR measurements of CsA in chloroform. When binding to its target cyclophilin, on the other hand, CsA adopts an “open” conformation without intramolecular hydrogen bonds. In this study, we attempted to sample the complete conformational space of CsA in chloroform and in water by molecular dynamics simulations in order to better understand its conformational behavior in these two environments and to rationalize the good membrane permeability of CsA observed experimentally. From 10 μs molecular dynamics simulations in each solvent, Markov state models were constructed to characterize the metastable conformational states. The model in chloroform is compared to nuclear Overhauser effect NMR spectroscopy data reported in this study and taken from the literature. The conformational landscapes in the two solvents show significant overlap but also clearly distinct features.	1655.0
figshare	Novel US-CpHMD Protocol to Study the Protonation-Dependent Mechanism of the ATP/ADP Carrier	We have designed a protocol combining constant-pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) simulations with an umbrella sampling (US) scheme (US-CpHMD) to study the mechanism of ADP/ATP transport (import and export) by their inner mitochondrial membrane carrier protein [ADP/ATP carrier (AAC)]. The US scheme helped overcome the limitations of sampling the slow kinetics involved in these substrates’ transport, while CpHMD simulations provided an unprecedented realism by correctly capturing the associated protonation changes. The import of anionic substrates along the mitochondrial membrane has a strong energetic disadvantage due to a smaller substrate concentration and an unfavorable membrane potential. These limitations may have created an evolutionary pressure on AAC to develop specific features benefiting the import of ADP. In our work, the potential of mean force profiles showed a clear selectivity in the import of ADP compared to ATP, while in the export, no selectivity was observed. We also observed that AAC sequestered both substrates at longer distances in the import compared to the export process. Furthermore, only in the import process do we observe transient protonation of both substrates when going through the AAC cavity, which is an important advantage to counteract the unfavorable mitochondrial membrane potential. Finally, we observed a substrate-induced disruption of the matrix salt-bridge network, which can promote the conformational transition (from the C- to M-state) required to complete the import process. This work unraveled several important structural features where the complex electrostatic interactions were pivotal to interpreting the protein function and illustrated the potential of applying the US-CpHMD protocol to other transport processes involving membrane proteins.	1900.0
figshare	Revealing the Unbinding Kinetics and Mechanism of Type I and Type II Protein Kinase Inhibitors by Local-Scaled Molecular Dynamics Simulations	Protein kinase inhibitors disrupt phosphorylation of the target kinases, which are an important class of drug for treating cancer and other diseases. Conventional structure-based design methods (such as molecular docking) focus on the static binding mode of the kinase inhibitor with its target. However, dissociation kinetic properties of a drug molecule are found to correlate with its residence time in vivo and thus have drawn the attention of drug designers in recent years. In this study, we have applied the local-scaled molecular dynamics (MD) simulation enabled in GROMACS software to explore the unbinding mechanism of a total of 41 type I and type II kinase inhibitors. Our simulation considered multiple starting configurations as well as possible protonation states of kinase inhibitors. Based on our local-scaled MD results, we discovered that the integrals of the favorable binding energy during dissociation correlated well (R2 = 0.64) with the experimental dissociation rate constants of those kinase inhibitors on the entire data set. Given its accuracy and technical advantage, this method may serve as a practical option for estimating this important property in reality. Our simulation also provided a reasonable explanation of the dynamic properties of kinase and its inhibitor as well as the role of relevant water molecules in dissociation.	1505.0
figshare	Modeling of Human Fatty Acid Synthase and in Silico Docking of Acyl Carrier Protein Domain and Its Partner Catalytic Domains	Human fatty acid synthase (hFAS) is a megasynthase whose main function is de novo biosynthesis of saturated fatty acids. Interest has been drawn to this enzyme beyond its physiological role due to the association between high levels of hFAS and clinical conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and cancer. Thus, it has become an undeniably attractive pharmacological target. Until now, no crystal structure of the complete hFAS is available, hindering attempts to fully understand this protein. Using homology modeling, we built a model of the entire megasynthase, encompassing all of its domains, including the acyl carrier protein (ACP) and thioesterase (TE) mobile domains absent in the crystal structure of mammalian fatty acid synthase (FAS). On a second stage, we used data-driven protein–protein docking between the substrate shuttling domain ACP and every catalytic domain in the protein. We also propose sets of amino acids at the interface of each domain that we believe are important to favor the interaction between ACP and each domain of hFAS. After inspection, we validated each complex between ACP and MAT/KS/KR/DH/ER domains through classical molecular dynamics simulations and RMSd analysis. Additionally, we mapped the interactions between the residues at the active site of each catalytic domain and its intermediaries. In every docking, we ensured that the distance between catalytic residues and the intermediaries was maintained. Until now, there was not a complete 3D model of this megasynthase. This study is the first to present a homology model for the whole hFAS, including its two mobile domains and possible poses of ACP throughout the cycle of fatty acid biosynthesis, thus mapping obligatory checkpoints in its trajectory. Hence, we believe that these structural insights will allow for future studies of the catalytic mechanism of the overall hFAS.	2002.0
figshare	Cooperative Supramolecular Block Copolymerization for the Synthesis of Functional Axial Organic Heterostructures	Supramolecular block copolymerzation with optically or electronically complementary monomers provides an attractive bottom-up approach for the non-covalent synthesis of nascent axial organic heterostructures, which promises to deliver useful applications in energy conversion, optoelectronics, and catalysis. However, the synthesis of supramolecular block copolymers (BCPs) constitutes a significant challenge due to the exchange dynamics of non-covalently bound monomers and hence requires fine microstructure control. Furthermore, temporal stability of the segmented microstructure is a prerequisite to explore the applications of functional supramolecular BCPs. Herein, we report the cooperative supramolecular block copolymerization of fluorescent monomers in solution under thermodynamic control for the synthesis of axial organic heterostructures with light-harvesting properties. The fluorescent nature of the core-substituted naphthalene diimide (cNDI) monomers enables a detailed spectroscopic probing during the supramolecular block copolymerization process to unravel a nucleation–growth mechanism, similar to that of chain copolymerization for covalent block copolymers. Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) imaging of BCP chains characterizes the segmented microstructure and also allows size distribution analysis to reveal the narrow polydispersity (polydispersity index (PDI) ≈ 1.1) for the individual block segments. Spectrally resolved fluorescence microscopy on single block copolymerized organic heterostructures shows energy migration and light-harvesting across the interfaces of linearly connected segments. Molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations provide useful mechanistic insights into the free energy of interaction between the monomers as well as into monomer exchange mechanisms and dynamics, which have a crucial impact on determining the copolymer microstructure. Our comprehensive spectroscopic, microscopic, and computational analyses provide an unambiguous structural, dynamic, and functional characterization of the supramolecular BCPs. The strategy presented here is expected to pave the way for the synthesis of multi-component organic heterostructures for various functions.	2336.0

It remains unclear how this supercoiling affects the detailed double-helical structure of DNA, largely because of limitations in spatial resolution of the available biophysical tools. In this study, the authors combined high-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reveal how supercoiling affects global and local DNA conformation, structure and dynamics in DNA minicircles of length 250-340 bp. The following procedures are described in more detail in the related article: generation and purification of small DNA circles, preparation and analysis of different topological species of minicircles, S1 nuclease digestions, atomic force microscopy, atomistic simulations and surface plasmon resonance.	7100.0
figshare	Understanding the Surface Reactivity of Ligand-Protected Metal Nanoparticles for Biomass Upgrading	Ligand-protected metal nanoparticles are widely used in heterogeneous catalysis and biomass upgrading. Thiolate surfactants can greatly improve the overall yield; however, the dynamics of the reacting species and the reaction mechanism have remained unknown at the molecular scale. We elucidated the interaction of a series of aromatic compounds with octadecylthiolate-modified palladium nanocatalysts in atomic detail and explain large increases in product selectivity and yield through a detailed reaction mechanism. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal adsorption free energies on the order of −5 kcal/mol on the ligand-modified nanoparticles, which are significantly smaller than those on bare metal surfaces, where −10 to −30 kcal/mol are found. The ligands induce a two-step process of condensation in the ligand shell and adsorption, leading to upright molecular orientations, in contrast to single-step adsorption on bare metal surfaces. Exothermic condensation into the ligand shell and binding to the metal surface are accompanied by large entropy losses due to the reduced mobility in the ligand shell and increased confinement of the alkyl chains. Results from molecular dynamics simulations using the interface force field (IFF) show impressive agreement with available thermochemical reference data from experiments. Upright orientations of aromatic alcohol reactants lower the activation energy for the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction and suppress competing decarbonylation reactions. The analysis of the HDO reaction mechanism by QM/MM calculations in the presence of the ligands as well as by DFT calculations under vacuum uncovers the acidic and basic properties of hydrogenated Pd surfaces. The rate-limiting step involves the transfer of Pd-bound hydrogen atoms to hydroxyl groups in the alcohol reactants. The mechanism explains prior experimental data and supports the rational design of metal and alloy catalysts of specific shape, ligand coverage, and reaction conditions for biomass upgrading.	2119.0
figshare	An On-the-Fly Deep Neural Network for Simulating Time-Resolved Spectroscopy: Predicting the Ultrafast Ring Opening Dynamics of 1,2-Dithiane	Revolutionary developments in ultrafast light source technology are enabling experimental spectro-scopists to probe the structural dynamics of molecules and materials on the femtosecond timescale. The capacity to investigate ultrafast processes afforded by these resources accordingly inspires the-oreticians to carry out high-level simulations which facilitate the interpretation of the underlying dynamics from ultrafast experiments. In this Article, we implement a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to convert excited-state molecular dynamics simulations into time-resolved spectroscopic signals. Our DNN is trained on-the-fly from first-principles theoretical data obtained from a set of time-evolving molecular dynamics. The train-test process iterates for each time-step of the dynamics data until the network can predict spectra with sufficient accuracy to replace the computationally intensive quan-tum chemistry calculations required to produce them, at which point it simulates the time-resolved spectra for longer timescales. The potential of this approach is demonstrated by probing dynamics of the the ring opening of 1,2-dithiane using sulphur K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The benefits of this strategy will be more markedly apparent for simulations of larger systems which will exhibit a more notable computational burden, making this approach applicable to the study of a diverse range of complex chemical dynamics.	1571.0
figshare	Mechanistic Insights into Substrate Positioning That Distinguish Non-heme Fe(II)/α-Ketoglutarate-Dependent Halogenases and Hydroxylases	Non-heme iron halogenases and hydroxylases activate inert C–H bonds to selectively catalyze the functionalization of diverse biological products under physiological conditions. To better understand the differences in substrate positioning key to their divergent reactivities, we compiled available crystallographic and spectroscopic data, which revealed that hydroxylases prefer an acute oxo–Fe–H target angle while halogenases prefer a more obtuse angle. With molecular dynamics simulations guided by this experimental information, we simulated the representative hydroxylases TauD and VioC and the halogenases BesD and WelO5 with both acute and obtuse harmonic restraints. We identified key substrate interaction partners that maintain the angle of approach in the respective enzymes, such as Asp94 in TauD and His127 in BesD. Moreover, our simulations reveal that the protein environment in halogenases prevents the sampling of acute angles observed in hydroxylases and vice versa. To validate these classical observations, we optimized the structure with large-scale quantum mechanical (QM) simulations and confirmed that QM-derived substrate–enzyme hydrogen bond strengths were higher in the native configurations. We computed reaction barriers for the rate-limiting hydrogen atom transfer step and found them to be slightly lower from an acute angle regardless of the enzyme–substrate complex. Analysis of the halogenase reaction coordinate reveals the formation of hydrogen bonding networks between the Fe(III)-hydroxyl, monodentate succinate, and a member of the second coordination sphere that may inhibit the hydroxyl rebound.	1771.0
figshare	Structural Dynamics of Carbon Dots in Water and N,N‑Dimethylformamide Probed by All-Atom Molecular Dynamics Simulations	Carbon dots (CDs), one of the youngest members of the carbon nanostructure family, are now widely experimentally studied for their tunable fluorescence properties, bleaching resistance, and biocompatibility. Their interaction with biomolecular systems has also been explored experimentally. However, many atomistic details still remain unresolved. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations enabling atomistic and femtosecond resolutions simultaneously are a well-established tool of computational chemistry which can provide useful insights into investigated systems. Here we present a full procedure for performing MD simulations of CDs. We developed a builder for generating CDs of a desired size and with various oxygen-containing surface functional groups. Further, we analyzed the behavior of various CDs differing in size, surface functional groups, and degrees of functionalization by MD simulations. These simulations showed that surface functionalized CDs are stable in a water environment through the formation of an extensive hydrogen bonding network. We also analyzed the internal dynamics of individual layers of CDs and evaluated the role of surface functional groups on CD stability. We observed that carboxyl groups interconnected the neighboring layers and decreased the rate of internal rotations. Further, we monitored changes in the CD shape caused by an excess of charged carboxyl groups or carbonyl groups. In addition to simulations in water, we analyzed the behavior of CDs in the organic solvent DMF, which decreased the stability of pure CDs but increased the level of interlayer hydrogen bonding. We believe that the developed protocol, builder, and parameters will facilitate future studies addressing various aspects of structural features of CDs and nanocomposites containing CDs.	1923.0

figshare	Free-Energy Simulations Support a Lipophilic Binding Route for Melatonin Receptors	The effects of the neurohormone melatonin are mediated by the activation of the GPCRs MT1 and MT2 in a variety of tissues. Crystal structures suggest ligand access to the orthosteric binding site of MT1 and MT2 receptors through a lateral channel between transmembrane (TM) helices IV and V. We investigated the feasibility of this lipophilic entry route for 2-iodomelatonin, a nonselective agonist with a slower dissociation rate from the MT2 receptor, applying enhanced sampling simulations and free-energy calculations. 2-Iodomelatonin unbinding was investigated with steered molecular dynamics simulations which revealed different trajectories passing through the gap between TM helices IV and V for both receptors. For one of these unbinding trajectories from the MT1 receptor, an umbrella-sampling protocol with path-collective variables provided a calculated energy barrier consistent with the experimental dissociation rate. The side-chain flexibility of Tyr5.38 was significantly different in the two receptor subtypes, as assessed by metadynamics simulations, and during ligand unbinding it frequently assumes an open conformation in the MT1 but not in the MT2 receptor, favoring 2-iodomelatonin egress. Taken together, our simulations are consistent with the possibility that the gap between TM IV and V is a way of connecting the orthosteric binding site and the membrane core for lipophilic melatonin receptor ligands. Our simulations also suggest that the open state of Tyr5.38 generates a small pocket on the surface of MT1 receptor, which could participate in the recognition of MT1-selective ligands and may be exploited in the design of new selective compounds.	1761.0
figshare	Understanding the Conformational Properties of Fluorinated Polypeptides: Molecular Modelling of Unguisin A	In this work, we investigate the conformational properties of unguisin A, a natural macrocyclic heptapeptide that incorporates a γ-aminobutyric acid (Gaba), and four of its difluorinated stereoisomers at the Gaba residue. According to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments, their secondary structure depends dramatically on the stereochemistry of the fluorinated carbon atoms. However, many molecular details of the structure and flexibility of these systems remain unknown, so that a rationale of the conformational changes induced by the fluorine atoms in the macrocycle is still missing. To fill this gap, we apply enhanced molecular dynamics (MD) techniques to explore the peptide conformational space in dimethyl sulfoxide solution followed by 4–8 μs of conventional MD simulations that provide extensive equilibrium sampling. The simulations, which compare reasonably well with the NMR-based observations, show that the secondary structure of the macrocycle is altered substantially upon fluorination, except for the (S,S) diastereomer. It also turns out that the conformations of the fluorinated peptides are visited during the enhanced MD simulation of natural unguisin A, suggesting thus that conformations accessible to the unsubstituted macrocyclic peptide may be selected by fluorination. Therefore, computational characterization of the macrocyclic peptides could be helpful in the rational design of stereoselective fluorinated peptides with fine-tuned conformation and activity.	1606.0
figshare	Forcefield_PTM: Ab Initio Charge and AMBER Forcefield Parameters for Frequently Occurring Post-Translational Modifications	In this work, we introduce Forcefield_PTM, a set of AMBER forcefield parameters consistent with ff03 for 32 common post-translational modifications. Partial charges were calculated through ab initio calculations and a two-stage RESP-fitting procedure in an ether-like implicit solvent environment. The charges were found to be generally consistent with others previously reported for phosphorylated amino acids, and trimethyllysine, using different parametrization methods. Pairs of modified structures and their corresponding unmodified structures were curated from the PDB for both single and multiple modifications. Background structural similarity was assessed in the context of secondary and tertiary structures from the global data set. Next, the charges derived for Forcefield_PTM were tested on a macroscopic scale using unrestrained all-atom Langevin molecular dynamics simulations in AMBER for 34 (17 pairs of modified/unmodified) systems in implicit solvent. Assessment was performed in the context of secondary structure preservation, stability in energies, and correlations between the modified and unmodified structure trajectories on the aggregate. As an illustration of their utility, the parameters were used to compare the structural stability of the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of OdhI. Microscopic comparisons between quantum and AMBER single point energies along key χ torsions on several PTMs were performed, and corrections to improve their agreement in terms of mean-squared errors and squared correlation coefficients were parametrized. This forcefield for post-translational modifications in condensed-phase simulations can be applied to a number of biologically relevant and timely applications including protein structure prediction, protein and peptide design, and docking and to study the effect of PTMs on folding and dynamics. We make the derived parameters and an associated interactive webtool capable of performing post-translational modifications on proteins using Forcefield_PTM available at http://selene.princeton.edu/FFPTM.	2199.0
figshare	Bulk Heterojunction Morphologies with Atomistic Resolution from Coarse-Grain Solvent Evaporation Simulations	Control over the morphology of the active layer of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells is paramount to achieve high-efficiency devices. However, no method currently available can predict morphologies for a novel donor–acceptor blend. An approach which allows reaching relevant length scales, retaining chemical specificity, and mimicking experimental fabrication conditions, and which is suited for high-throughput schemes has been proven challenging to find. Here, we propose a method to generate atom-resolved morphologies of BHJs which conforms to these requirements. Coarse-grain (CG) molecular dynamics simulations are employed to simulate the large-scale morphological organization during solution-processing. The use of CG models which retain chemical specificity translates into a direct path to the rational design of donor and acceptor compounds which differ only slightly in chemical nature. Finally, the direct retrieval of fully atomistic detail is possible through backmapping, opening the way for improved quantum mechanical calculations addressing the charge separation mechanism. The method is illustrated for the poly­(3-hexyl-thiophene) (P3HT)–phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) mixture, and found to predict morphologies in agreement with experimental data. The effect of drying rate, P3HT molecular weight, and thermal annealing are investigated extensively, resulting in trends mimicking experimental findings. The proposed methodology can help reduce the parameter space which has to be explored before obtaining optimal morphologies not only for BHJ solar cells but also for any other solution-processed soft matter device.	1774.0
figshare	Combining Linear-Scaling DFT with Subsystem DFT in Born–Oppenheimer and Ehrenfest Molecular Dynamics Simulations: From Molecules to a Virus in Solution	In this work, methods for the efficient simulation of large systems embedded in a molecular environment are presented. These methods combine linear-scaling (LS) Kohn–Sham (KS) density functional theory (DFT) with subsystem (SS) DFT. LS DFT is efficient for large subsystems, while SS DFT is linear scaling with a smaller prefactor for large sets of small molecules. The combination of SS and LS, which is an embedding approach, can result in a 10-fold speedup over a pure LS simulation for large systems in aqueous solution. In addition to a ground-state Born–Oppenheimer SS+LS implementation, a time-dependent density functional theory-based Ehrenfest molecular dynamics (EMD) using density matrix propagation is presented that allows for performing nonadiabatic dynamics. Density matrix-based EMD in the SS framework is naturally linear scaling and appears suitable to study the electronic dynamics of molecules in solution. In the LS framework, linear scaling results as long as the density matrix remains sparse during time propagation. However, we generally find a less than exponential decay of the density matrix after a sufficiently long EMD run, preventing LS EMD simulations with arbitrary accuracy. The methods are tested on various systems, including spectroscopy on dyes, the electronic structure of TiO2 nanoparticles, electronic transport in carbon nanotubes, and the satellite tobacco mosaic virus in explicit solution.	1586.0

The methodology is validated by computing the solvation free energy of ibuprofen in water, methanol, and ethanol at 300 K and 1 bar and comparing to reference simulation results using Bennett’s acceptance ratio method. Difficulties with ibuprofen using conventional molecular dynamics methods stem from an inadequate sampling of the carboxylic acid functional group, which, for the present study, is subject to free energy barriers of rotation of 14–20 kBT. While several advances have been made to overcome such weaknesses, we demonstrate how this shortcoming is easily overcome by using an expanded ensemble methodology to facilitate conformational sampling. Not only does the method enhance conformational sampling but it also boosts the rate of exploration of the configurational phase space and requires only a single simulation to calculate the solvation free energy. Agreement between the expanded ensemble and the reference calculations is good for all three solvents, with the reported uncertainties of the expanded ensemble being comparable to the uncertainties of the reference calculations, while requiring less simulation time; the reduced simulation time demonstrates the improved performance gained from the expanded ensemble method.	1556.0
figshare	Force-Field-Based Computational Study of the Thermodynamics of a Large Set of Aqueous Alkanolamine Solvents for Post-Combustion CO2 Capture	The ability to predict the thermodynamic properties of amine species in CO2-loaded aqueous solutions, including their deprotonation (pKa) and carbamate to bicarbonate reversion (pKc) equilibrium constants and their corresponding standard reaction enthalpies, is of critical importance for the design of improved carbon capture solvents. In this study, we used isocoulombic forms of both reactions to determine these quantities for a large set of aqueous alkanolamine solvent systems. Our hybrid approach involves using classical molecular dynamics simulations with the general amber force field (GAFF) and semi-empirical AM1–BCC charges (GAFF/AM1–BCC) in the solution phase, combined with high-level composite quantum chemical ideal-gas calculations. We first determined a new force field (FF) for the hydronium ion (H3O+) by matching to the single experimental pKa data point for the well-known monoethanolamine system at 298.15 K. We then used this FF to predict the pKa values for 76 other amines at 298.15 K and for all 77 amines at elevated temperatures. Additionally, we indirectly relate the H3O+ hydration free energy to that of H+ and provide expressions for intrinsic hydration free energy and enthalpy of the proton. Using the derived H3O+ FF, we predicted the pKa values of a diverse set of alkanolamines with an overall average absolute deviation of less than 0.72 pKa units. Furthermore, the derived H3O+ FF is able to predict the protonation enthalpy of these amines when used with the GAFF. We also predicted the carbamate reversion constants of the primary and secondary amine species in the data set and their corresponding standard heats of reaction, which we compared with the scarcely available experimental data, which are often subject to significant uncertainty. Finally, we also described the influence of electronic and steric effects of different molecular fragments/groups on the stabilities of the carbamates.	2077.0
figshare	Photoswitching of DNA Hybridization Using a Molecular Motor	Reversible control over the functionality of biological systems via external triggers may be used in future medicine to reduce the need for invasive procedures. Additionally, externally regulated biomacromolecules are now considered as particularly attractive tools in nanoscience and the design of smart materials, due to their highly programmable nature and complex functionality. Incorporation of photoswitches into biomolecules, such as peptides, antibiotics, and nucleic acids, has generated exciting results in the past few years. Molecular motors offer the potential for new and more precise methods of photoregulation, due to their multistate switching cycle, unidirectionality of rotation, and helicity inversion during the rotational steps. Aided by computational studies, we designed and synthesized a photoswitchable DNA hairpin, in which a molecular motor serves as the bridgehead unit. After it was determined that motor function was not affected by the rigid arms of the linker, solid-phase synthesis was employed to incorporate the motor into an 8-base-pair self-complementary DNA strand. With the photoswitchable bridgehead in place, hairpin formation was unimpaired, while the motor part of this advanced biohybrid system retains excellent photochemical properties. Rotation of the motor generates large changes in structure, and as a consequence the duplex stability of the oligonucleotide could be regulated by UV light irradiation. Additionally, Molecular Dynamics computations were employed to rationalize the observed behavior of the motor–DNA hybrid. The results presented herein establish molecular motors as powerful multistate switches for application in biological environments.	1765.0
figshare	Understanding the Mannose Transfer Mechanism of Mycobacterial Phosphatidyl-myo-inositol Mannosyltransferase A from Molecular Dynamics Simulations	Glycolipids like phosphatidylinositol hexamannosides (PIM6) and lipoglycans, such as lipomannan (LM) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM), play crucial roles in virulence, survival, and antibiotic resistance of various mycobacterial species. Phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosyltransferase A (PimA) catalyzes the transfer of the mannose moiety (M) from GDP-mannose (GDPM) to phosphatidyl-myo-inositol (PI) to synthesize GDP and phosphatidyl-myo-inositol monomannoside (PIM). This PIM is mannosylated, acylated, and further modified to give rise to the higher PIMs, LM, and LAM. It is yet to be known how PI, PIM, PI-GDPM, and PIM-GDP interact with PimA. Here, we report the docked structures of PI and PIM to understand how the substrates and the products interact with PimA. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for 300 ns, we have investigated how various ligand-bound conformations change the dynamics of PimA. Our studies demonstrated the “open to closed” motions of PimA. We observed that PimA is least dynamic when bound to both GDPM and PI. MD simulations indicated that the loop residues 59–70 and the α-helical residues 73–86 of PimA play important roles while interacting with both PI and PIM. MD analyses also suggested that the residues Y9, P59, R68, L69, N97, R196, R201, K202, and R228 of PimA play significant roles in the mannose transfer reaction. Overall, docking studies and MD simulations provide crucial insights to design future therapeutic drugs against mycobacterial PimA.	1635.0
figshare	Rapid interpretation of small-angle X-ray scattering data	The fundamental aim of structural analyses in biophysics is to reveal a mutual relation between a molecule’s dynamic structure and its physiological function. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is an experimental technique for structural characterization of macromolecules in solution and enables time-resolved analysis of conformational changes under physiological conditions. As such experiments measure spatially averaged low-resolution scattering intensities only, the sparse information obtained is not sufficient to uniquely reconstruct a three-dimensional atomistic model. Here, we integrate the information from SAXS into molecular dynamics simulations using computationally efficient native structure-based models. Dynamically fitting an initial structure towards a scattering intensity, such simulations produce atomistic models in agreement with the target data. In this way, SAXS data can be rapidly interpreted while retaining physico-chemical knowledge and sampling power of the underlying force field. We demonstrate our method’s performance using the example of three protein systems. Simulations are faster than full molecular dynamics approaches by more than two orders of magnitude and consistently achieve comparable accuracy. Computational demands are reduced sufficiently to run the simulations on commodity desktop computers instead of high-performance computing systems. These results underline that scattering-guided structure-based simulations provide a suitable framework for rapid early-stage refinement of structures towards SAXS data with particular focus on minimal computational resources and time.	1688.0
figshare	Microsecond Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Lipid Mixing	Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of membranes are often hindered by the slow lateral diffusion of lipids and the limited time scale of MD. In order to study the dynamics of mixing and characterize the lateral distribution of lipids in converged mixtures, we report microsecond-long all-atom MD simulations performed on the special-purpose machine Anton. Two types of mixed bilayers, POPE:POPG (3:1) and POPC:cholesterol (2:1), as well as a pure POPC bilayer, were each simulated for up to 2 μs. These simulations show that POPE:POPG and POPC:cholesterol are each fully miscible at the simulated conditions, with the final states of the mixed bilayers similar to a random mixture. By simulating three POPE:POPG bilayers at different NaCl concentrations (0, 0.15, and 1 M), we also examined the effect of salt concentration on lipid mixing. While an increase in NaCl concentration is shown to affect the area per lipid, tail order, and lipid lateral diffusion, the final states of mixing remain unaltered, which is explained by the largely uniform increase in Na+ ions around POPE and POPG. Direct measurement of water permeation reveals that the POPE:POPG bilayer with 1 M NaCl has reduced water permeability compared with those at zero or low salt concentration. Our calculations provide a benchmark to estimate the convergence time scale of all-atom MD simulations of lipid mixing. Additionally, equilibrated structures of POPE:POPG and POPC:cholesterol, which are frequently used to mimic bacterial and mammalian membranes, respectively, can be used as starting points of simulations involving these membranes.	1673.0
figshare	Q‑Band Electron-Nuclear Double Resonance Reveals Out-of-Plane Hydrogen Bonds Stabilize an Anionic Ubisemiquinone in Cytochrome bo3 from Escherichia coli	The respiratory cytochrome bo3 ubiquinol oxidase from Escherichia coli has a high-affinity ubiquinone binding site that stabilizes the one-electron reduced ubisemiquinone (SQH), which is a transient intermediate during the electron-mediated reduction of O2 to water. It is known that SQH is stabilized by two strong hydrogen bonds from R71 and D75 to ubiquinone carbonyl oxygen O1 and weak hydrogen bonds from H98 and Q101 to O4. In this work, SQH was investigated with orientation-selective Q-band (∼34 GHz) pulsed 1H electron–nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy on fully deuterated cytochrome (cyt) bo3 in a H2O solvent so that only exchangeable protons contribute to the observed ENDOR spectra. Simulations of the experimental ENDOR spectra provided the principal values and directions of the hyperfine (hfi) tensors for the two strongly coupled H-bond protons (H1 and H2). For H1, the largest principal component of the proton anisotropic hfi tensor Tz′ = 11.8 MHz, whereas for H2, Tz′ = 8.6 MHz. Remarkably, the data show that the direction of the H1 H-bond is nearly perpendicular to the quinone plane (∼70° out of plane). The orientation of the second strong hydrogen bond, H2, is out of plane by ∼25°. Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations on a membrane-embedded model of the cyt bo3 QH site show that these H-bond orientations are plausible but do not distinguish which H-bond, from R71 or D75, is nearly perpendicular to the quinone ring. Density functional theory calculations support the idea that the distances and geometries of the H-bonds to the ubiquinone carbonyl oxygens, along with the measured proton anisotropic hfi couplings, are most compatible with an anionic (deprotonated) ubisemiquinone.	1881.0
figshare	Modeling Gd3+ Complexes for Molecular Dynamics Simulations: Toward a Rational Optimization of MRI Contrast Agents	The correct parametrization of lanthanide complexes is of the utmost importance for their characterization using computational tools such as molecular dynamics simulations. This allows the optimization of their properties for a wide range of applications, including medical imaging. Here we present a systematic study to establish the best strategies for the correct parametrization of lanthanide complexes using [Gd­(DOTA)]− as a reference, which is used as a contrast agent in MRI. We chose the bonded model to parametrize the lanthanide complexes, which is especially important when considering the study of the complex as a whole (e.g., for the study of the dynamics of its interaction with proteins or membranes). We followed two strategies: a so-called heuristic approach employing strategies already published by other authors and another based on the more recent MCPB.py tool. Adjustment of the Lennard-Jones parameters of the metal was required. The final topologies obtained with both strategies were able to reproduce the experimental ion to oxygen distance, vibrational frequencies, and other structural properties. We report a new strategy to adjust the Lennard-Jones parameters of the metal ion in order to capture dynamic properties such as the residence time of the capping water (τm). For the first time, the correct assessment of the τm value for Gd-based complexes was possible by recording the dissociative events over up to 10 μs all-atom simulations. The MCPB.py tool allowed the accurate parametrization of [Gd­(DOTA)]− in a simpler procedure, and in this case, the dynamics of the water molecules in the outer hydration sphere was also characterized. This sphere was divided into the first hydration layer, an intermediate region, and an outer hydration layer, with a residence time of 18, 10 and 19 ps, respectively, independent of the nonbonded parameters chosen for Gd3+. The Lennard-Jones parameters of Gd3+ obtained here for [Gd­(DOTA)]− may be used with similarly structured gadolinium MRI contrast agents. This allows the use of molecular dynamics simulations to characterize and optimize the contrast agent properties. The characterization of their interaction with membranes and proteins will permit the design of new targeted contrast agents with improved pharmacokinetics.	2420.0
figshare	Structural Studies of Supramolecular G‑Quadruplexes Formed from 8‑Aryl-2′-deoxyguanosine Derivatives	Self-assembly is a powerful tool for the construction of complex nanostructures. Despite advances in the field, the development of precise self-assembled structures remains a challenge. We have shown that, in the presence of suitably sized cations like K+, 8-aryl-2′-deoxyguanosine (8ArG) derivatives self-assemble into sets of coaxially stacked planar tetramers, which we term supramolecular G-quadruplexes (SGQs). Previously, we reported that, when the 8-aryl group is a phenyl ring with a meta-carbonyl group, the resulting supramolecule is a hexadecamer, which is remarkably robust as illustrated by its isostructural assembly in both organic and aqueous environments. We report here a detailed three-dimensional structure of the SGQs formed by lipophilic, and hydrophilic, 8ArG derivatives with either 8-(meta-acetylphenyl), 8-(para-acetylphenyl), or 8-(meta-ethoxycarbonylphenyl) groups. The chirality and close contacts between the subunits impose different levels of steric and electrostatic constraints on opposite sides of the tetrads, which determine their preferred relative orientation. The balance between attractive noncovalent interactions juxtaposed with repulsive steric and electrostatic interactions explains the high cooperativity, fidelity, and stability of these SGQs. These structural studies, together with titration experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, provide insight into the mechanism of formation of these SGQs.	1552.0
figshare	Functional Loop Dynamics and Characterization of the Inactive State of the NS2B-NS3 Dengue Protease due to Allosteric Inhibitor Binding	Dengue virus, a flavivirus that causes dengue shock syndrome and dengue hemorrhagic fever, is currently prevalent worldwide. A two-component protease (NS2B-NS3) is essential for maturation, representing an important target for designing anti-flavivirus drugs. Previously, consideration has been centered on developing active-site inhibitors of NS2B-NS3pro. However, the flat and charged nature of its active site renders difficulties in developing inhibitors, suggesting an alternative strategy for identifying allosteric inhibitors. The allosterically sensitive site of the dengue protease is located near Ala125, between the 120s loop and 150s loop. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we have explored the protease’s conformational dynamics upon binding of an allosteric inhibitor. Furthermore, characterization of the inherent flexible loops (71–75s loop, 120s loop, and 150s loop) is carried out for allosteric-inhibitor-bound wild-type and mutant A125C variants and a comparison is performed with its unbound state to extract the structural changes describing the inactive state of the protease. Our study reveals that compared to the unliganded system, the inhibitor-bound system shows large structural changes in the 120s loop and 150s loop in contrast to the rigid 71–75s loop. The unliganded system shows a closed-state pocket in contrast to the open state for the wild-type complex that locks the protease into the open and inactive-state conformations. However, the mutant complex fluctuates between open and closed states. Also, we tried to see how mutation and binding of an allosteric inhibitor perturb the connectivity in a protein structure network (PSN) at contact levels. Altogether, our study reveals the mechanism of conformational rearrangements of loops at the molecular level, locking the protein in an inactive conformation, which may be useful for developing allosteric inhibitors.	2054.0
figshare	Reaction Mechanism of MHETase, a PET Degrading Enzyme	In 2016, one of the two enzymes involved in the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) degradation pathway of Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, MHETase, was found to exhibit a strong ability to degrade the PET monomer mono-(2-hydroxyethyl)­terephthalate (MHET) at room temperature, converting it back into the precursors used in PET production. MHETase engineering to improve efficiency is an active field that suffers from an incomplete characterization of its reaction mechanism. In this paper, we analyze the reaction mechanism of MHETase using umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations at the B3LYP/MM level of theory. The combination of a high theoretical level and extensive sampling generated a very robust computational prediction. We found that MHETase catalyzed the conversion of MHET in two steps, with a rate-limiting step activation barrier of ΔG⧧ = 19.35 ± 0.15 kcal·mol–1 (from the weighted-histogram analysis). Our calculations are in line with the hypothesis that a transient tetrahedral intermediate mediates the reaction mechanism in each step, which is quite common in the serine hydrolase class. The energy of the first tetrahedral intermediate was similar to that of the reactant state, while the tetrahedral intermediate of the deacylation step was observed to lie closer to the rate-limiting transition state. Nevertheless, both determined tetrahedral states were found to be transient, with activation barriers close to ∼2.0 kcal·mol–1 relative to the product state of the acylation and deacylation steps, corresponding to a half-life of about 3 ps at 303.15 K.	1635.0
figshare	Insights into the Atomistic Mechanisms of Phosphorylation in Disrupting Liquid–Liquid Phase Separation and Aggregation of the FUS Low-Complexity Domain	Fused in sarcoma (FUS), a nuclear RNA binding protein, can not only undergo liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) to form dynamic biomolecular condensates but also aggregate into solid amyloid fibrils which are associated with the pathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration diseases. Phosphorylation in the FUS low-complexity domain (FUS-LC) inhibits FUS LLPS and aggregation. However, it remains largely elusive what are the underlying atomistic mechanisms of this inhibitory effect and whether phosphorylation can disrupt preformed FUS fibrils, reversing the FUS gel/solid phase toward the liquid phase. Herein, we systematically investigate the impacts of phosphorylation on the conformational ensemble of the FUS37–97 monomer and dimer and the structure of the FUS37–97 fibril by performing extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulations reveal three key findings: (1) phosphorylation shifts the conformations of FUS37–97 from the β-rich, fibril-competent state toward a helix-rich, fibril-incompetent state; (2) phosphorylation significantly weakens protein–protein interactions and enhances protein–water interactions, which disfavor FUS-LC LLPS as well as aggregation and facilitate the dissolution of the preformed FUS-LC fibril; and (3) the FUS37–97 peptide displays a high β-strand probability in the region spanning residues 52–67, and phosphorylation at S54 and S61 residues located in this region is crucial for the disruption of LLPS and aggregation of FUS-LC. This study may pave the way for ameliorating phase-separation-related pathologies via site-specific phosphorylation.	1800.0
figshare	Allostery in the dengue virus NS3 helicase: Insights into the NTPase cycle from molecular simulations	The C-terminus domain of non-structural 3 (NS3) protein of the Flaviviridae viruses (e.g. HCV, dengue, West Nile, Zika) is a nucleotide triphosphatase (NTPase) -dependent superfamily 2 (SF2) helicase that unwinds double-stranded RNA while translocating along the nucleic polymer. Due to these functions, NS3 is an important target for antiviral development yet the biophysics of this enzyme are poorly understood. Microsecond-long molecular dynamic simulations of the dengue NS3 helicase domain are reported from which allosteric effects of RNA and NTPase substrates are observed. The presence of a bound single-stranded RNA catalytically enhances the phosphate hydrolysis reaction by affecting the dynamics and positioning of waters within the hydrolysis active site. Coupled with results from the simulations, electronic structure calculations of the reaction are used to quantify this enhancement to be a 150-fold increase, in qualitative agreement with the experimental enhancement factor of 10–100. Additionally, protein-RNA interactions exhibit NTPase substrate-induced allostery, where the presence of a nucleotide (e.g. ATP or ADP) structurally perturbs residues in direct contact with the phosphodiester backbone of the RNA. Residue-residue network analyses highlight pathways of short ranged interactions that connect the two active sites. These analyses identify motif V as a highly connected region of protein structure through which energy released from either active site is hypothesized to move, thereby inducing the observed allosteric effects. These results lay the foundation for the design of novel allosteric inhibitors of NS3.	1748.0
figshare	Molecular Dynamics with Chemical AccuracyAlkane Adsorption in Acidic Zeolites	For the adsorption of methane to hexane on acidic zeolites with varying pore sizes (Socony Mobil-5 (MFI), chabazite (CHA), faujasite (FAU)) and Brønsted acid site concentrations, heats of adsorption are predicted. The widely applied “standard model” of computational catalysis, density functional theory with some account of dispersion (DFT-D) and the harmonic approximation for local sampling of the potential energy surface (PES), leads to a large mean absolute deviation (MAD) from experiment of 17.2 kJ mol–1, far outside chemical accuracy limits (±4 kJ mol–1). Passing either to molecular dynamics (MD) at the DFT-D level or to wave function-based electron correlation methods (second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory  MP2) for energies at local minimum structures reduces the MAD to 8.7 and 5.9 kJ mol–1, respectively, still outside the chemical accuracy range. We present MD simulations on an MP2 quality PES, which strongly reduces the MAD to 1.9 kJ mol–1. This has been achieved by finding two descriptors for the MP2–DFT-D energy differences, which reduces the total number of required MP2 calculations to only 36 and, hence, the computational demand by several orders of magnitude. The predicted heats of adsorption at reaction temperatures (650 K) support experimental results derived from spectroscopic measurements. They show that the observed decrease of experimental apparent barriers from propane to pentane for alkane cracking in MFI (28 kJ mol–1) is largely due to increasing adsorption strengths (21 kJ mol–1) and to a much smaller extent to decreasing intrinsic barriers (7 kJ mol–1).	1692.0
figshare	Best Practices in Constant pH MD Simulations: Accuracy and Sampling	Various approaches have been proposed to include the effect of pH in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Among these, the λ-dynamics approach proposed by Brooks and co-workers [Kong, X.; Brooks III, C. L. J. Chem. Phys. 1996, 105, 2414−2423] can be performed with little computational overhead and hfor each typeence be used to routinely perform MD simulations at microsecond time scales, as shown in the accompanying paper [Aho, N. et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2022, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00516]. At such time scales, however, the accuracy of the molecular mechanics force field and the parametrization becomes critical. Here, we address these issues and provide the community with guidelines on how to set up and perform long time scale constant pH MD simulations. We found that barriers associated with the torsions of side chains in the CHARMM36m force field are too high for reaching convergence in constant pH MD simulations on microsecond time scales. To avoid the high computational cost of extending the sampling, we propose small modifications to the force field to selectively reduce the torsional barriers. We demonstrate that with such modifications we obtain converged distributions of both protonation and torsional degrees of freedom and hence consistent pKa estimates, while the sampling of the overall configurational space accessible to proteins is unaffected as compared to normal MD simulations. We also show that the results of constant pH MD depend on the accuracy of the correction potentials. While these potentials are typically obtained by fitting a low-order polynomial to calculated free energy profiles, we find that higher order fits are essential to provide accurate and consistent results. By resolving problems in accuracy and sampling, the work described in this and the accompanying paper paves the way to the widespread application of constant pH MD beyond pKa prediction.	1981.0
figshare	Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species at Phospholipid Bilayers: Peroxynitrous Acid and Its Homolysis Products	Peroxynitrite is a powerful and long-lived oxidant generated in vivo. Peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH), its protonated form, may penetrate into phospholipid bilayers and undergo homolytic cleavage to nitrogen dioxide (·NO2) and hydroxyl radicals (·OH), causing severe nitro-oxidative damage. The membrane environment is thought to influence ONOOH reactions, but the mechanisms remain speculative. Most experimental techniques lack the level of resolution required to keep track of the motion of very reactive species and their interactions with the membrane. Here, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the permeation, interactions, and dynamics of ONOOH and its homolysis products in the phospholipid membrane environment. We started by developing an ONOOH model that successfully accounted for its conformational equilibria and solvation energies. Membrane permeation of ONOOH was accompanied by conformational changes. ONOOH exhibited a strong tendency to bind to and accumulate at the membrane headgroup region. There, ONOOH homolysis led to ·NO2 radicals, which in turn partitioned to the membrane interior. About one-third of the ·OH radicals readily escaped to the aqueous phase within 1 ns. However, a significant number of ·OH radicals became trapped at the lipid headgroup region for a longer period. The possible implications for membrane-based nitration and oxidation processes were discussed.	1516.0
figshare	Force Field Benchmark of Organic Liquids: Density, Enthalpy of Vaporization, Heat Capacities, Surface Tension, Isothermal Compressibility, Volumetric Expansion Coefficient, and Dielectric Constant	The chemical composition of small organic molecules is often very similar to amino acid side chains or the bases in nucleic acids, and hence there is no a priori reason why a molecular mechanics force field could not describe both organic liquids and biomolecules with a single parameter set. Here, we devise a benchmark for force fields in order to test the ability of existing force fields to reproduce some key properties of organic liquids, namely, the density, enthalpy of vaporization, the surface tension, the heat capacity at constant volume and pressure, the isothermal compressibility, the volumetric expansion coefficient, and the static dielectric constant. Well over 1200 experimental measurements were used for comparison to the simulations of 146 organic liquids. Novel polynomial interpolations of the dielectric constant (32 molecules), heat capacity at constant pressure (three molecules), and the isothermal compressibility (53 molecules) as a function of the temperature have been made, based on experimental data, in order to be able to compare simulation results to them. To compute the heat capacities, we applied the two phase thermodynamics method (Lin et al. J. Chem. Phys. 2003, 119, 11792), which allows one to compute thermodynamic properties on the basis of the density of states as derived from the velocity autocorrelation function. The method is implemented in a new utility within the GROMACS molecular simulation package, named g_dos, and a detailed exposé of the underlying equations is presented. The purpose of this work is to establish the state of the art of two popular force fields, OPLS/AA (all-atom optimized potential for liquid simulation) and GAFF (generalized Amber force field), to find common bottlenecks, i.e., particularly difficult molecules, and to serve as a reference point for future force field development. To make for a fair playing field, all molecules were evaluated with the same parameter settings, such as thermostats and barostats, treatment of electrostatic interactions, and system size (1000 molecules). The densities and enthalpy of vaporization from an independent data set based on simulations using the CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF) presented by Vanommeslaeghe et al. (J. Comput. Chem. 2010, 31, 671) are included for comparison. We find that, overall, the OPLS/AA force field performs somewhat better than GAFF, but there are significant issues with reproduction of the surface tension and dielectric constants for both force fields.	2710.0
figshare	Implementing and Assessing an Alchemical Method for Calculating Protein–Protein Binding Free Energy	Protein–protein binding is fundamental to most biological processes. It is important to be able to use computation to accurately estimate the change in protein–protein binding free energy due to mutations in order to answer biological questions that would be experimentally challenging, laborious, or time-consuming. Although nonrigorous free-energy methods are faster, rigorous alchemical molecular dynamics-based methods are considerably more accurate and are becoming more feasible with the advancement of computer hardware and molecular simulation software. Even with sufficient computational resources, there are still major challenges to using alchemical free-energy methods for protein–protein complexes, such as generating hybrid structures and topologies, maintaining a neutral net charge of the system when there is a charge-changing mutation, and setting up the simulation. In the current study, we have used the pmx package to generate hybrid structures and topologies, and a double-system/single-box approach to maintain the net charge of the system. To test the approach, we predicted relative binding affinities for two protein–protein complexes using a nonequilibrium alchemical method based on the Crooks fluctuation theorem and compared the results with experimental values. The method correctly identified stabilizing from destabilizing mutations for a small protein–protein complex, and a larger, more challenging antibody complex. Strong correlations were obtained between predicted and experimental relative binding affinities for both protein–protein systems.	1681.0
figshare	Atomistic Models of General Anesthetics for Use in in Silico Biological Studies	While small molecules have been used to induce anesthesia in a clinical setting for well over a century, a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we utilize ab initio calculations to develop a novel set of CHARMM-compatible parameters for the ubiquitous modern anesthetics desflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, and propofol for use in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The parameters generated were rigorously tested against known experimental physicochemical properties including dipole moment, density, enthalpy of vaporization, and free energy of solvation. In all cases, the anesthetic parameters were able to reproduce experimental measurements, signifying the robustness and accuracy of the atomistic models developed. The models were then used to study the interaction of anesthetics with the membrane. Calculation of the potential of mean force for inserting the molecules into a POPC bilayer revealed a distinct energetic minimum of 4–5 kcal/mol relative to aqueous solution at the level of the glycerol backbone in the membrane. The location of this minimum within the membrane suggests that anesthetics partition to the membrane prior to binding their ion channel targets, giving context to the Meyer–Overton correlation. Moreover, MD simulations of these drugs in the membrane give rise to computed membrane structural parameters, including atomic distribution, deuterium order parameters, dipole potential, and lateral stress profile, that indicate partitioning of anesthetics into the membrane at the concentration range studied here, which does not appear to perturb the structural integrity of the lipid bilayer. These results signify that an indirect, membrane-mediated mechanism of channel modulation is unlikely.	1855.0
figshare	DataSheet3_Exploring the mechanism of Alisma orientale for the treatment of pregnancy induced hypertension and potential hepato-nephrotoxicity by using network pharmacology, network toxicology, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation.zip	Background: Pregnancy-induced Hypertension (PIH) is a disease that causes serious maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Alisma Orientale (AO) has a long history of use as traditional Chinese medicine therapy for PIH. This study explores its potential mechanism and biosafety based on network pharmacology, network toxicology, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation.Methods: Compounds of AO were screened in TCMSP, TCM-ID, TCM@Taiwan, BATMAN, TOXNET and CTD database; PharmMapper and SwissTargetPrediction, GeneCards, DisGeNET and OMIM databases were used to predict the targets of AO anti-PIH. The protein-protein interaction analysis and the KEGG/GO enrichment analysis were applied by STRING and Metascape databases, respectively. Then, we constructed the “herb-compound-target-pathway-disease” map in Cytoscape software to show the core regulatory network. Finally, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation were applied to analyze binding affinity and reliability. The same procedure was conducted for network toxicology to illustrate the mechanisms of AO hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity.Results: 29 compounds with 78 potential targets associated with the therapeutic effect of AO on PIH, 10 compounds with 117 and 111 targets associated with AO induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity were obtained, respectively. The PPI network analysis showed that core therapeutic targets were IGF, MAPK1, AKT1 and EGFR, while PPARG and TNF were toxicity-related targets. Besides, GO/KEGG enrichment analysis showed that AO might modulate the PI3K-AKT and MAPK pathways in treating PIH and mainly interfere with the lipid and atherosclerosis pathways to induce liver and kidney injury.

figshare	Mechanism of Glycans Modulating Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein: Unveiled by Molecular Dynamics Simulation	Inhibition of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) has been considered as a promising way for the treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for three decades. However, clinical trials of several CETP inhibitors with various potencies have been marginally successful at best, raising doubts on the target drugability of CETP. The in-depth understanding of the glycosylated CETP structure could be beneficial to more definitive descriptions of the CETP function and the underlying mechanism. In this work, large-scale molecular dynamics simulations were performed to thoroughly explore the mechanism of glycans modulating CETP. Here, the extensive simulation results intensely suggest that glycan88 tends to assist CETP in forming a continuous tunnel throughout interacting with the upper-right region of the N-barrel, while it also could prevent the formation of a continuous tunnel by swinging toward the right-rear of the N-barrel. Furthermore, glycan240 formed stable H-bonds with Helix-B and might further stabilize the central cavity of CETP. Furthermore, the nonspecific involvement of the hydroxyl groups from the various glycans with protein core interactions and the similar influence of different glycans trapped at similar regions on the protein structure suggest that physiological glycan may lead to a similar effect. This study would provide valuable insights into devising novel methods for CVD treatment targeting CETP and functional studies about glycosylation for other systems.	1613.0

figshare	Validation of the Generalized Force Fields GAFF, CGenFF, OPLS-AA, and PRODRGFF by Testing Against Experimental Osmotic Coefficient Data for Small Drug-Like Molecules	Accurate force field parameters for proteins and drugs are of fundamental importance for predicting protein-drug binding poses and binding free energies in structure-based drug design. Osmotic pressure simulations have recently gained popularity as a means to validate common force fields for biomolecules such as proteins; up to now, however, little such effort has been made to use these methods to validate common force fields for small drug-like molecules. In this work, osmotic coefficients of 16 drug-like molecules were calculated from osmotic pressure molecular dynamics simulations using four common force fields for drug-like molecules: GAFF, CGenFF, OPLS-AA, and PRODRGFF. While GAFF, CGenFF, and OPLS-AA produced osmotic coefficients that are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental osmotic coefficients, PRODRGFF, which attempts to use GROMOS parameters, often produced osmotic coefficients that are in poor agreement. All four force fields poorly reproduced the experimental osmotic coefficients of purine-derived molecules including purine, 6-methylpurine, and caffeine, suggesting common issues in describing interactions of this particular molecule type. The poor overall performance of PRODRGFF can be mainly attributed to the poor results with two macrocyclic molecules HMT and TAT, which can be significantly improved by reparameterizing the van der Waals (vdW) parameters of alkyl carbons and using lower solute concentration. In addition, the recently developed GAFF2 with revamped vdW parameters was found to produce osmotic coefficients that are in slightly better agreement with experiments than GAFF. Overall, the four common force fields for drug-like molecules tested in this study performed reasonably well at reproducing experimental osmotic coefficients of drug-like molecules, although failures of certain force fields on certain molecules suggest that further force field reparameterizations, especially for vdW parameters, might be required to improve their accuracy.	2180.0
figshare	Hydrogen-Bonding Polarizable Intermolecular Potential Model for Water	A polarizable intermolecular potential model with short-range directional hydrogen-bonding interactions was developed for water. The model has a rigid geometry, with bond lengths and angles set to experimental gas-phase values. Dispersion interactions are represented by the Buckingham potential assigned to the oxygen atom, whereas electrostatic interactions are modeled by Gaussian charges. Polarization is handled by a Drude oscillator site, using a negative Gaussian charge attached to the oxygen atom by a harmonic spring. An explicit hydrogen-bonding term is included in the model to account for the effects of charge transfer. The model parameters were optimized to density, configurational energy, pair correlation function, and the dielectric constant of water under ambient conditions, as well as the minimum gas-phase dimer energy. Molecular dynamics and Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo simulations were performed to evaluate the new model with respect to the thermodynamic and transport properties over a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions. Good agreement between model predictions and experimental data was found for most of the properties studied. The new model yields better performance relative to the majority of existing models and outperforms the BK3 model, which is one of the best polarizable models, for vapor–liquid equilibrium properties, whereas the new model is not better than the BK3 model for representation of other properties. The model can be efficiently simulated with the thermalized Drude oscillator algorithm, resulting in computational costs only 3 times higher than those of the nonpolarizable TIP4P/2005 model, whereas having significantly improved properties. Because it involves only a single Drude oscillator site, the new model is significantly faster than polarizable models with multiple sites. With the explicit inclusion of hydrogen-bond interactions, the model may provide a better description of the phase behavior of aqueous mixtures.	2063.0
figshare	Iterative Molecular Dynamics–Rosetta Membrane Protein Structure Refinement Guided by Cryo-EM Densities	Knowing atomistic details of proteins is essential not only for the understanding of protein function but also for the development of drugs. Experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography, NMR, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) are the preferred forms of protein structure determination and have achieved great success over the most recent decades. Computational methods may be an alternative when experimental techniques fail. However, computational methods are severely limited when it comes to predicting larger macromolecule structures with little sequence similarity to known structures. The incorporation of experimental restraints in computational methods is becoming increasingly important to more reliably predict protein structure. One such experimental input used in structure prediction and refinement is cryo-EM densities. Recent advances in cryo-EM have arguably revolutionized the field of structural biology. Our previously developed cryo-EM-guided Rosetta–MD protocol has shown great promise in the refinement of soluble protein structures. In this study, we extended cryo-EM density-guided iterative Rosetta–MD to membrane proteins. We also improved the methodology in general by picking models based on a combination of their score and fit-to-density during the Rosetta model selection. By doing so, we have been able to pick models superior to those with the previous selection based on Rosetta score only and we have been able to further improve our previously refined models of soluble proteins. The method was tested with five membrane spanning protein structures. By applying density-guided Rosetta-MD iteratively we were able to refine the predicted structures of these membrane proteins to atomic resolutions. We also showed that the resolution of the density maps determines the improvement and quality of the refined models. By incorporating high-resolution density maps (∼4 Å), we were able to more significantly improve the quality of the models than when medium-resolution maps (6.9 Å) were used. Beginning from an average starting structure root mean square deviation (RMSD) to native of 4.66 Å, our protocol was able to refine the structures to bring the average refined structure RMSD to 1.66 Å when 4 Å density maps were used. The protocol also successfully refined the HIV-1 CTD guided by an experimental 5 Å density map.	2468.0
figshare	Development and Validation of the Quantum Mechanical Bespoke Protein Force Field	Molecular mechanics force field parameters for macromolecules, such as proteins, are traditionally fit to reproduce experimental properties of small molecules, and thus, they neglect system-specific polarization. In this paper, we introduce a complete protein force field that is designed to be compatible with the quantum mechanical bespoke (QUBE) force field by deriving nonbonded parameters directly from the electron density of the specific protein under study. The main backbone and sidechain protein torsional parameters are rederived in this work by fitting to quantum mechanical dihedral scans for compatibility with QUBE nonbonded parameters. Software is provided for the preparation of QUBE input files. The accuracy of the new force field, and the derived torsional parameters, is tested by comparing the conformational preferences of a range of peptides and proteins with experimental measurements. Accurate backbone and sidechain conformations are obtained in molecular dynamics simulations of dipeptides, with NMR J coupling errors comparable to the widely used OPLS force field. In simulations of five folded proteins, the secondary structure is generally retained, and the NMR J coupling errors are similar to standard transferable force fields, although some loss of the experimental structure is observed in certain regions of the proteins. With several avenues for further development, the use of system-specific nonbonded force field parameters is a promising approach for next-generation simulations of biological molecules.	1625.0
figshare	Complex Behavior of Phosphatidylcholine–Phosphatidic Acid Bilayers and Monolayers: Effect of Acyl Chain Unsaturation	Phosphatidic acids (PAs) have many biological functions in biomembranes, e.g., they are involved in the proliferation, differentiation, and transformation of cells. Despite decades of research, the molecular understanding of how PAs affect the properties of biomembranes remains elusive. In this study, we explored the properties of lipid bilayers and monolayers composed of PAs and phosphatidylcholines (PCs) with various acyl chains. For this purpose, the Langmuir monolayer technique and atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to study the miscibility of PA and PC lipids and the molecular organization of mixed bilayers. The monolayer experiments demonstrated that the miscibility of membrane components strongly depends on the structure of the hydrocarbon chains and thus on the overall lipid shape. Interactions between PA and PC molecules vary from repulsive, for systems containing lipids with saturated and unsaturated acyl tails (strongly positive values of the excess free energy of mixing), to attractive, for systems in which all lipid tails are saturated (negative values of the excess free energy of mixing). The MD simulations provided atomistic insight into polar interactions (formation of hydrogen bonds and charge pairs) in PC–PA systems. H-bonding between PA monoanions and PCs in mixed bilayers is infrequent, and the lipid molecules interact mainly via electrostatic interactions. However, the number of charge pairs significantly decreases with the number of unsaturated lipid chains in the PA–PC system. The PA dianions weakly interact with the zwitterionic lipids, but their headgroups are more hydrated as compared to the monoanionic form. The acyl chains in all PC–PA bilayers are more ordered compared to single-component PC systems. In addition, depending on the combination of lipids, we observed a deeper location of the PA phosphate groups compared to the PC phosphate groups, which can alter the presentation of PAs for the peripheral membrane proteins, affecting their accessibility for binding.	2163.0
figshare	Local Environment and Dynamic Behavior of Fluoride Anions in Silicogermanate Zeolites: A Computational Study of the AST Framework	In silicogermanate zeolites containing double four-ring (d4r) building units, the germanium atoms preferentially occupy the corners of these cube-like units, but the absence of long-range order precludes the determination of the preferred arrangements of Si and Ge atoms by means of crystallographic methods. If fluoride anions are present during the synthesis, they are incorporated into these cages. Because of the sensitivity of the 19F chemical shift to the local environment, NMR experiments can provide indirect insights into the predominant (Si,Ge) arrangements. However, conflicting interpretations have been reported, both with regard to the preference for, or avoidance of, Ge–O–Ge linkages, and concerning the equilibrium position of fluoride inside the cage, where fluoride might either occupy the cage center or participate in a partly covalent Ge–F bond. In order to shed light on the energetically preferred local arrangements, periodic dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed for the AST framework, which is synthetically accessible across the range of (Si1–n,Gen)­O2 compositions (0 ≤ n ≤ 1). DFT structure optimizations for (Si,Ge)-AST systems containing fluoride anions and organic cations revealed that arrangements of Si and Ge which maximize the number of Ge–O–Ge linkages are energetically preferred and that fluoride tends to form relatively short (∼2.2–2.4 Å) bonds to Ge atoms surrounded by Ge–O–Ge linkages. The preference for Ge–O–Ge linkages disappears in the absence of fluoride. DFT-based molecular dynamics calculations were performed for selected AST models to analyze the dynamics of fluoride anions confined to d4r cages. These calculations showed that the freedom of movement of fluoride varies depending on the local environment and that it correlates with the average Ge–F distance. An analysis of the Ge–F radial distribution functions provided no evidence for a coexistence of separate local energy minima at the cage center and in the proximity of a germanium atom. The computational approach pursued in this work provides important new insights into the local structure of silicogermanate zeolites with d4r units, enhancing the atomic-level understanding of these materials. In particular, the findings presented here constitute valuable complementary information that can aid the interpretation of experimental data.	2529.0
figshare	A 5′-Flanking C/G Pair at the Core Region Enhances the Recognition and Binding of Kaiso to Methylated DNA	Methyl CpG binding proteins (MBPs) are transcription factors that recognize the methylated CpG sites in DNA and mediate the DNA methylation signal into various downstream cellular processes. The C2H2 zinc finger (ZF) protein, Kaiso, also an MBP, preferentially binds to two symmetrically methylated CpG sites in DNA sequences via C-terminal C2H2 ZF domains and mediates the transcription regulation process. Investigation of the molecular mechanism of the recognition of methylated DNA (meDNA) by Kaiso is important to understand how this protein reads and translates this methylation signal into downstream transcription outcomes. Despite previous studies in Kaiso-meDNA interactions, detailed structural investigations on the sequence-specific interaction of Kaiso with the meDNA sequence are still lacking. In this work, we used molecular modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation-based computational approaches to investigate the recognition of various methylated DNA sequences by Kaiso. Our MD simulation results show that the Kaiso-meDNA interaction is sequence specific. The recognition of meDNA by Kaiso is enhanced in the MeECad sequence compared to the MeCG2 sequence. Compared to the 5′-flanking T/A pair in MeCG2, both MeCG2_mutCG and MeECad sequences show that a C/G base pair allows GLU535 of Kaiso to preferably recognize and bind the core mCpG site. The core mCGmCG site is crucial for the recognition process and formation of a stable complex. Our results reveal that the 5′-flanking nucleotides are also important for the enhanced binding and recognition of methylated sites.	1704.0
figshare	Binding Modes of Ligands Using Enhanced Sampling (BLUES): Rapid Decorrelation of Ligand Binding Modes via Nonequilibrium Candidate Monte Carlo	Accurately predicting protein–ligand binding affinities and binding modes is a major goal in computational chemistry, but even the prediction of ligand binding modes in proteins poses major challenges. Here, we focus on solving the binding mode prediction problem for rigid fragments. That is, we focus on computing the dominant placement, conformation, and orientations of a relatively rigid, fragment-like ligand in a receptor, and the populations of the multiple binding modes which may be relevant. This problem is important in its own right, but is even more timely given the recent success of alchemical free energy calculations. Alchemical calculations are increasingly used to predict binding free energies of ligands to receptors. However, the accuracy of these calculations is dependent on proper sampling of the relevant ligand binding modes. Unfortunately, ligand binding modes may often be uncertain, hard to predict, and/or slow to interconvert on simulation time scales, so proper sampling with current techniques can require prohibitively long simulations. We need new methods which dramatically improve sampling of ligand binding modes. Here, we develop and apply a nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) method to improve sampling of ligand binding modes. In this technique, the ligand is rotated and subsequently allowed to relax in its new position through alchemical perturbation before accepting or rejecting the rotation and relaxation as a nonequilibrium Monte Carlo move. When applied to a T4 lysozyme model binding system, this NCMC method shows over 2 orders of magnitude improvement in binding mode sampling efficiency compared to a brute force molecular dynamics simulation. This is a first step toward applying this methodology to pharmaceutically relevant binding of fragments and, eventually, drug-like molecules. We are making this approach available via our new Binding modes of ligands using enhanced sampling (BLUES) package which is freely available on GitHub.	2144.0
figshare	Redox Potential Tuning through Differential Quinone Binding in the Photosynthetic Reaction Center of Rhodobacter sphaeroides	Ubiquinone forms an integral part of the electron transport chain in cellular respiration and photosynthesis across a vast number of organisms. Prior experimental results have shown that the photosynthetic reaction center (RC) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides is only fully functional with a limited set of methoxy-bearing quinones, suggesting that specific interactions with this substituent are required to drive electron transport and the formation of quinol. The nature of these interactions has yet to be determined. Through parameterization of a CHARMM-compatible quinone force field and subsequent molecular dynamics simulations of the quinone-bound RC, we have investigated and characterized the interactions of the protein with the quinones in the QA and QB sites using both equilibrium simulation and thermodynamic integration. In particular, we identify a specific interaction between the 2-methoxy group of ubiquinone in the QB site and the amide nitrogen of GlyL225 that we implicate in locking the orientation of the 2-methoxy group, thereby tuning the redox potential difference between the quinones occupying the QA and QB sites. Disruption of this interaction leads to weaker binding in a ubiquinone analogue that lacks a 2-methoxy group, a finding supported by reverse electron transfer electron paramagnetic resonance experiments of the QA–QB– biradical and competitive binding assays.	1524.0
figshare	Importance of Three-Body Problems and Protein–Protein Interactions in Proteolysis-Targeting Chimera Modeling: Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulations	Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are a class of bifunctional molecules that can induce the ubiquitin degradation of its target protein by hijacking the E3 ligase to form a target protein-PROTAC-E3 ligase ternary complex. Its underlying principle has inspired the development of a wide range of protein degraders that are similar to or beyond PROTACs in recent years. The formation of the ternary complexes is the key to the success of PROTAC-induced protein degradation. Nevertheless, the lack of effective ternary complex modeling techniques has limited the application of computer-aided drug discovery tools to this emerging and fast developing new land in drug industry. Thus, in this study, we explored the application of the more physically sound molecular dynamics simulation and the molecular mechanics combined with the generalized Born and surface area continuum solvation (MM/GBSA) method to solve the underlying three-body problem in PROTAC modeling. We first verified the accuracy of our approach using a series of known Brd4 BD2 degraders. The calculated binding energy showed a good correlation with the experimental Kd values. The modeling of a unique property, namely, the α value, for PROTACs was also first and accurately performed to our best knowledge. The results also demonstrated the importance of PROTAC-induced protein–protein interactions in its modeling, either qualitatively or quantitatively. Finally, by standing on the success of earlier docking-based approaches, our protocol was also applied as a rescoring function in pose prediction. The results showed a notable improvement in reranking the initial poses generated from a modified Rosetta method, which was reportedly one of the best among a handful of PROTAC modeling approaches available in this field. We hope this work could provide a practical protocol and more insights to study the binding and the design of PROTACs and other protein degraders.	2099.0
figshare	Extended Adaptive Biasing Force Algorithm. An On-the-Fly Implementation for Accurate Free-Energy Calculations	Proper use of the adaptive biasing force (ABF) algorithm in free-energy calculations needs certain prerequisites to be met, namely, that the Jacobian for the metric transformation and its first derivative be available and the coarse variables be independent and fully decoupled from any holonomic constraint or geometric restraint, thereby limiting singularly the field of application of the approach. The extended ABF (eABF) algorithm circumvents these intrinsic limitations by applying the time-dependent bias onto a fictitious particle coupled to the coarse variable of interest by means of a stiff spring. However, with the current implementation of eABF in the popular molecular dynamics engine NAMD, a trajectory-based post-treatment is necessary to derive the underlying free-energy change. Usually, such a posthoc analysis leads to a decrease in the reliability of the free-energy estimates due to the inevitable loss of information, as well as to a drop in efficiency, which stems from substantial read-write accesses to file systems. We have developed a user-friendly, on-the-fly code for performing eABF simulations within NAMD. In the present contribution, this code is probed in eight illustrative examples. The performance of the algorithm is compared with traditional ABF, on the one hand, and the original eABF implementation combined with a posthoc analysis, on the other hand. Our results indicate that the on-the-fly eABF algorithm (i) supplies the correct free-energy landscape in those critical cases where the coarse variables at play are coupled to either each other or to geometric restraints or holonomic constraints, (ii) greatly improves the reliability of the free-energy change, compared to the outcome of a posthoc analysis, and (iii) represents a negligible additional computational effort compared to regular ABF. Moreover, in the proposed implementation, guidelines for choosing two parameters of the eABF algorithm, namely the stiffness of the spring and the mass of the fictitious particles, are proposed. The present on-the-fly eABF implementation can be viewed as the second generation of the ABF algorithm, expected to be widely utilized in the theoretical investigation of recognition and association phenomena relevant to physics, chemistry, and biology.	2403.0
figshare	Reaction Mechanism of the PET Degrading Enzyme PETase Studied with DFT/MM Molecular Dynamics Simulations	Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has been widely used to make disposable bottles, among others, leading to massive PET waste accumulation in the environment. The discovery of the Ideonella sakaiensis PETase and MHETase enzymes, which hydrolyze PET into its constituting monomers, opened the possibility of a promising route for PET biorecycling. We describe an atomistic and thermodynamic interpretation of the catalytic reaction mechanism of PETase using umbrella sampling simulations at the robust PBE/MM MD level with a large QM region. The reaction mechanism takes place in two stages, acylation and deacylation, each of which occurs through a single, associative, concerted and asynchronous step. Acylation consists of proton transfer from Ser131 to His208, concerted with a nucleophilic attack by Ser131 on the substrate, leading to a tetrahedral transition state, which subsequently results in the release of MHET after the breaking of the ester bond. Deacylation is driven by deprotonation of an active site water molecule by His208, with the resulting hydroxide attacking the acylated Ser131 intermediate and breaking its bond to the substrate. Subsequently, His208 transfers the water proton to Ser131, with ensuant formation of MHET and enzyme regeneration. The rate-limiting acylation has a free energy barrier of 20.0 kcal·mol–1, consistent with the range of experimental values of 18.0–18.7 kcal·mol–1. Finally, we identify residues whose mutation should increase the enzyme turnover. Specifically, mutation of Asp83, Asp89, and Asp157 by nonpositive residues is expected to decrease the barrier of the rate-limiting step. This work led to the understanding of the catalytic mechanism of PETase and opened the way for additional rational enzyme engineering.	1875.0
figshare	Role of Enzyme and Active Site Conformational Dynamics in the Catalysis by α‑Amylase Explored with QM/MM Molecular Dynamics	We assessed enzyme:substrate conformational dynamics and the rate-limiting glycosylation step of a human pancreatic α-amylase:maltopentose complex. Microsecond molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the distance of the catalytic Asp197 nucleophile to the anomeric carbon of the buried glucoside is responsible for most of the enzyme active site fluctuations and that both Asp197 and Asp300 interact the most with the buried glucoside unit. The buried glucoside binds either in a 4C1 chair or 2SO skew conformations, both of which can change to TS-like conformations characteristic of retaining glucosidases. Starting from four distinct enzyme:substrate complexes, umbrella sampling quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations (converged within less than 1 kcal·mol–1 within a total simulation time of 1.6 ns) indicated that the reaction occurrs with a Gibbs barrier of 13.9 kcal·mol –1, in one asynchronous concerted step encompassing an acid–base reaction with Glu233 followed by a loose SN2-like nucleophilic substitution by the Asp197. The transition state is characterized by a 2H3 half-chair conformation of the buried glucoside that quickly changes to the E3 envelope conformation preceding the attack of the anomeric carbon by the Asp197 nucleophile. Thermodynamic analysis of the reaction supported that a water molecule tightly hydrogen bonded to the glycosidic oxygen of the substrate at the reactant state (∼1.6 Å) forms a short hydrogen bond with Glu233 at the transition state (∼1.7 Å) and lowers the Gibbs barrier in over 5 kcal·mol–1. The resulting Asp197-glycosyl was mostly found in the 4C1 conformation, although the more endergonic B3,O conformation was also observed. Altogether, the combination of short distances for the acid–base reaction with the Glu233 and for the nucleophilic attack by the Asp197 nucleophile and the availability of water within hydrogen bonding distance of the glycosidic oxygen provides a reliable criteria to identify reactive conformations of α-amylase complexes.	2147.0
figshare	Role of Enzyme and Active Site Conformational Dynamics in the Catalysis by α‑Amylase Explored with QM/MM Molecular Dynamics	We assessed enzyme:substrate conformational dynamics and the rate-limiting glycosylation step of a human pancreatic α-amylase:maltopentose complex. Microsecond molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the distance of the catalytic Asp197 nucleophile to the anomeric carbon of the buried glucoside is responsible for most of the enzyme active site fluctuations and that both Asp197 and Asp300 interact the most with the buried glucoside unit. The buried glucoside binds either in a 4C1 chair or 2SO skew conformations, both of which can change to TS-like conformations characteristic of retaining glucosidases. Starting from four distinct enzyme:substrate complexes, umbrella sampling quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations (converged within less than 1 kcal·mol–1 within a total simulation time of 1.6 ns) indicated that the reaction occurrs with a Gibbs barrier of 13.9 kcal·mol –1, in one asynchronous concerted step encompassing an acid–base reaction with Glu233 followed by a loose SN2-like nucleophilic substitution by the Asp197. The transition state is characterized by a 2H3 half-chair conformation of the buried glucoside that quickly changes to the E3 envelope conformation preceding the attack of the anomeric carbon by the Asp197 nucleophile. Thermodynamic analysis of the reaction supported that a water molecule tightly hydrogen bonded to the glycosidic oxygen of the substrate at the reactant state (∼1.6 Å) forms a short hydrogen bond with Glu233 at the transition state (∼1.7 Å) and lowers the Gibbs barrier in over 5 kcal·mol–1.

figshare	Hydration-Dependent Dynamical Modes in Xyloglucan from Molecular Dynamics Simulation of 13C NMR Relaxation Times and Their Distributions	Macromolecular dynamics in biological systems, which play a crucial role for biomolecular function and activity at ambient temperature, depend strongly on moisture content. Yet, a generally accepted quantitative model of hydration-dependent phenomena based on local relaxation and diffusive dynamics of both polymer and its adsorbed water is still missing. In this work, atomistic-scale spatial distributions of motional modes are calculated using molecular dynamics simulations of hydrated xyloglucan (XG). These are shown to reproduce experimental hydration-dependent 13C NMR longitudinal relaxation times (T1) at room temperature, and relevant features of their broad distributions, which are indicative of locally heterogeneous polymer reorientational dynamics. At low hydration, the self-diffusion behavior of water shows that water molecules are confined to particular locations in the randomly aggregated XG network while the average polymer segmental mobility remains low. Upon increasing water content, the hydration network becomes mobile and fully accessible for individual water molecules, and the motion of hydrated XG segments becomes faster. Yet, the polymer network retains a heterogeneous gel-like structure even at the highest level of hydration. We show that the observed distribution of relaxations times arises from the spatial heterogeneity of chain mobility that in turn is a result of heterogeneous distribution of water–chain and chain–chain interactions. Our findings contribute to the picture of hydration-dependent dynamics in other macromolecules such as proteins, DNA, and synthetic polymers, and hold important implications for the mechanical properties of polysaccharide matrixes in plants and plant-based materials.	1884.0
figshare	Preferential Ionic Interactions and Microscopic Structural Changes Drive Nonideality in Binary Ionic Liquid Mixtures as Revealed from Molecular Simulations	Thermophysical and structural properties of two binary mixtures of ionic liquids were determined in this study using molecular dynamics simulations at 353 K. The mixtures contains common cation and different anions, combining 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium [C4mim]+ chloride [Cl]− with two other ionic liquids, namely, [C4mim]+ methylsulfate [MeSO4]− and [C4mim]+ bis­(trifluoro­methane­sulfonyl)­imide [NTf2]−. Each mixture was characterized in terms of thermodynamic quantities such as densities and excess molar volumes and transport properties specifically self-diffusion coefficients and ionic conductivities, using seven molar compositions (0:00, 10:90, 25:75, 50:50, 75:25, 90:10, 100:0). Excess molar volumes for the two binary ionic liquid mixtures exhibited small deviations from ideality; the Cl-[MeSO4] system showed negative deviation while positive deviation was observed for the Cl-[NTf2] system. Structural analysis elucidated in terms of radial distribution functions, orientations of the anions around cation through angular distribution functions, and spatial distribution functions revealed that the significant changes in the ionic interactions occur within the first solvation shell of the cations and these changes are responsible for the observed nonideality. The self-diffusion coefficients of the ions were found to decrease monotonically with Cl– concentration for both the mixtures. Further, predictions of ionic conductivities using both the Nernst–Einstein formalism and Einstein relationship pointed to the presence of correlated ionic motion which was confirmed by the long ion-pair relaxation time constants especially for the anion present as a minor component.	1849.0
figshare	DataSheet2_A Computational Model for the PLP-Dependent Enzyme Methionine γ-Lyase.zip	Pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP) is a cofactor in the reactions of over 160 enzymes, several of which are implicated in diseases. Methionine γ-lyase (MGL) is of interest as a therapeutic protein for cancer treatment. It binds PLP covalently through a Schiff base linkage and digests methionine, whose depletion is damaging for cancer cells but not normal cells. To improve MGL activity, it is important to understand and engineer its PLP binding. We develop a simulation model for MGL, starting with force field parameters for PLP in four main states: two phosphate protonation states and two tautomeric states, keto or enol for the Schiff base moiety. We used the force field to simulate MGL complexes with each form, and showed that those with a fully-deprotonated PLP phosphate, especially keto, led to the best agreement with MGL structures in the PDB. We then confirmed this result through alchemical free energy simulations that compared the keto and enol forms, confirming a moderate keto preference, and the fully-deprotonated and singly-protonated phosphate forms. Extensive simulations were needed to adequately sample conformational space, and care was needed to extrapolate the protonation free energy to the thermodynamic limit of a macroscopic, dilute protein solution. The computed phosphate pKa was 5.7, confirming that the deprotonated, −2 form is predominant. The PLP force field and the simulation methods can be applied to all PLP enzymes and used, as here, to reveal fine details of structure and dynamics in the active site.	1626.0
figshare	Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics Density Functional Theory Simulations of the Optical Properties Fingerprinting the Ligand-Binding of Pentameric Formyl Thiophene Acetic Acid in Amyloid-β(1–42)	The binding pocket proposed by König [Chem. Commun. 2018, 54, 3030–3033] for the biomarker pentameric formyl thiophene acetic acid (p-FTAA) in the fibrillar structure of amyloid-β(1–42) has been put to the test by the comparison of theoretical and experimental optical absorption and fluorescence spectra obtained in a water environment and inside the protein scaffold. The optical absorption/emission properties of this luminescent conjugated oligothiophene were studied by means of classical force field molecular dynamics simulations to account for the sampling of configuration space in conjunction with polarizable embedding time-dependent density functional theory calculations of spectra. The nuclear motions of residues in the β-sheet were found to be modest, and the time dependence of embedding parameters was shown to be negligible so that a time-independent parameter set could be derived and used for all 300 snapshots considered in the spectrum averaging. In regard to linear absorption spectra, the calculated red shift due to protein binding for the dominant S1 ← S0 transition in p-FTAA was found to be equal to 23 nm (0.17 eV), which is in excellent agreement with the corresponding experimental result of 18 nm and taken as corroborating evidence for having correctly identified the binding pocket of p-FTAA in the amyloid. The underlying mechanisms for the calculated red shift were disentangled, and it is shown that some 20 nm (0.15 eV) of the total 23 nm (0.17 eV) is associated with increased planarity of p-FTAA in the binding pocket, whereas a mere 3 nm (0.02 eV) is associated with changes in the environment. In regard to emission spectra, we demonstrate that intersystem crossing from the excited S1 state to the triplet manifold of states is a less likely event for p-FTAA in the binding pocket as compared to in the aqueous solution, and we thereby partly explain the much higher quantum yield of fluorescence for the more rigid p-FTAA in the binding pocket. Two-photon absorption in p-FTAA is shown to predominantly occur to an overall symmetric excited state and be more than twice as strong for the biomarker in the binding pocket as compared to in water. The corresponding red shift, on the other hand, is very small. Earlier experimental two-photon fluorescence imaging using p-FTAA is shown not to target the dominant two-photon state, and ways to reach a higher image quality (lower signal-to-noise ratio) are proposed in terms of tuning the laser wavelength toward the region of 600 nm or the synthesis of asymmetric ligands with S1 states that are both one- and two-photon allowed.	2819.0
figshare	Dataflow programming for the analysis of molecular dynamics with AViS, an analysis and visualization software application	The study of molecular dynamics simulations is largely facilitated by analysis and visualization toolsets. However, these toolsets are often designed for specific use cases and those only, while scripting extensions to such toolsets is often exceedingly complicated. To overcome this problem, we designed a software application called AViS which focuses on the extensibility of analysis. By utilizing the dataflow programming (DFP) paradigm, algorithms can be defined by execution graphs, and arbitrary data can be transferred between nodes using visual connectors. Extension nodes can be implemented in either Python, C++, and Fortran, and combined in the same algorithm. AViS offers a comprehensive collection of nodes for sophisticated visualization state modifications, thus greatly simplifying the rules for writing extensions. Input files can also be read from the server automatically, and data is fetched automatically to improve memory usage. In addition, the visualization system of AViS uses physically-based rendering techniques, improving the 3D perception of molecular structures for interactive visualization. By performing two case studies on complex molecular systems, we show that the DFP workflow offers a much higher level of flexibility and extensibility when compared to legacy workflows. The software source code and binaries for Windows, MacOS, and Linux are freely available at https://avis-md.github.io/.	1551.0
figshare	CHARMM Force-Fields with Modified Polyphosphate Parameters Allow Stable Simulation of the ATP-Bound Structure of Ca2+-ATPase	Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is an indispensable energy source in cells. In a wide variety of biological phenomena like glycolysis, muscle contraction/relaxation, and active ion transport, chemical energy released from ATP hydrolysis is converted to mechanical forces to bring about large-scale conformational changes in proteins. Investigation of structure–function relationships in these proteins by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations requires modeling of ATP in solution and ATP bound to proteins with accurate force-field parameters. In this study, we derived new force-field parameters for the triphosphate moiety of ATP based on the high-precision quantum calculations of methyl triphosphate. We tested our new parameters on membrane-embedded sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase and four soluble proteins. The ATP-bound structure of Ca2+-ATPase remains stable during MD simulations, contrary to the outcome in shorter simulations using original parameters. Similar results were obtained with the four ATP-bound soluble proteins. The new force-field parameters were also tested by investigating the range of conformations sampled during replica-exchange MD simulations of ATP in explicit water. Modified parameters allowed a much wider range of conformational sampling compared with the bias toward extended forms with original parameters. A diverse range of structures agrees with the broad distribution of ATP conformations in proteins deposited in the Protein Data Bank. These simulations suggest that the modified parameters will be useful in studies of ATP in solution and of the many ATP-utilizing proteins.	1742.0
figshare	Sarcin/Ricin Domain RNA Retains Its Structure Better Than A‑RNA in Adaptively Biased Molecular Dynamics Simulations	Less than one in thirty of the RNA sequences transcribed in humans are translated into protein. The noncoding RNA (ncRNA) functions in catalysis, structure, regulation, and more. However, for the most part, these functions are poorly characterized. RNA is modular and described by motifs that include helical A-RNA with canonical Watson–Crick base-pairing as well as structures with only noncanonical base pairs. Understanding the structure and dynamics of motifs will aid in deciphering functions of specific ncRNAs. We present computational studies on a standard sarcin/ricin domain (SRD), citrus bark cracking viroid SRD, as well as A-RNA. We have applied enhanced molecular dynamics techniques that construct an inverse free-energy surface (iFES) determined by collective variables that monitor base-pairing and backbone conformation. Each SRD RNA is flanked on each side by A-RNA, allowing comparison of the behavior of these motifs in the same molecule. The RNA iFESs have single peaks, indicating that the combined motifs should denature as a single cohesive unit, rather than by regional melting. Local root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) analysis and communication propensity (CProp, variance in distances between residue pairs) reveal distinct motif properties. Our analysis indicates that the standard SRD is more stable than the viroid SRD, which is more stable than A-RNA. Base pairs at SRD to A-RNA transitions have limited flexibility. Application of CProp reveals extraordinary stiffness of the SRD, allowing residues on opposite sides of the motif to sense each other’s motions.	1708.0
figshare	Ensembles Are Required to Handle Aleatoric and Parametric Uncertainty in Molecular Dynamics Simulation	Classical molecular dynamics is a computer simulation technique that is in widespread use across many areas of science, from physics and chemistry to materials, biology, and medicine. The method continues to attract criticism due its oft-reported lack of reproducibility which is in part due to a failure to submit it to reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ). Here we show that the uncertainty arises from a combination of (i) the input parameters and (ii) the intrinsic stochasticity of the method controlled by the random seeds. To illustrate the situation, we make a systematic UQ analysis of a widely used molecular dynamics code (NAMD), applied to estimate binding free energy of a ligand-bound to a protein. In particular, we replace the usually fixed input parameters with random variables, systematically distributed about their mean values, and study the resulting distribution of the simulation output. We also perform a sensitivity analysis, which reveals that, out of a total of 175 parameters, just six dominate the variance in the code output. Furthermore, we show that binding energy calculations dampen the input uncertainty, in the sense that the variation around the mean output free energy is less than the variation around the mean of the assumed input distributions, if the output is ensemble-averaged over the random seeds. Without such ensemble averaging, the predicted free energy is five times more uncertain. The distribution of the predicted properties is thus strongly dependent upon the random seed. Owing to this substantial uncertainty, robust statistical measures of uncertainty in molecular dynamics simulation require the use of ensembles in all contexts.	1794.0

figshare	Role of ATP in the RNA Translocation Mechanism of SARS-CoV‑2 NSP13 Helicase	The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the need to develop potent and transferable therapeutics to treat coronavirus infections. Numerous antiviral targets are being investigated, but nonstructural protein 13 (nsp13) stands out as a highly conserved and yet understudied target. Nsp13 is a superfamily 1 (SF1) helicase that translocates along and unwinds viral RNA in an ATP-dependent manner. Currently, there are no available structures of nsp13 from SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 with either ATP or RNA bound, which presents a significant hurdle to the rational design of therapeutics. To address this knowledge gap, we have built models of SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 in Apo, ATP, ssRNA and ssRNA+ATP substrate states. Using 30 μs of a Gaussian-accelerated molecular dynamics simulation (at least 6 μs per substrate state), these models were confirmed to maintain substrate binding poses that are similar to other SF1 helicases. A Gaussian mixture model and linear discriminant analysis structural clustering protocol was used to identify key structural states of the ATP-dependent RNA translocation mechanism. Namely, four RNA-nsp13 structures are identified that exhibit ATP-dependent populations and support the inchworm mechanism for translocation. These four states are characterized by different RNA-binding poses for motifs Ia, IV, and V and suggest a power stroke-like motion of domain 2A relative to domain 1A. This structural and mechanistic insight of nsp13 RNA translocation presents novel targets for the further development of antivirals.	1614.0
figshare	Thermodynamically Consistent Force Fields for the Assembly of Inorganic, Organic, and Biological Nanostructures: The INTERFACE Force Field	The complexity of the molecular recognition and assembly of biotic–abiotic interfaces on a scale of 1 to 1000 nm can be understood more effectively using simulation tools along with laboratory instrumentation. We discuss the current capabilities and limitations of atomistic force fields and explain a strategy to obtain dependable parameters for inorganic compounds that has been developed and tested over the past decade. Parameter developments include several silicates, aluminates, metals, oxides, sulfates, and apatites that are summarized in what we call the INTERFACE force field. The INTERFACE force field operates as an extension of common harmonic force fields (PCFF, COMPASS, CHARMM, AMBER, GROMACS, and OPLS-AA) by employing the same functional form and combination rules to enable simulations of inorganic–organic and inorganic–biomolecular interfaces. The parametrization builds on an in-depth understanding of physical–chemical properties on the atomic scale to assign each parameter, especially atomic charges and van der Waals constants, as well as on the validation of macroscale physical–chemical properties for each compound in comparison to measurements. The approach eliminates large discrepancies between computed and measured bulk and surface properties of up to 2 orders of magnitude using other parametrization protocols and increases the transferability of the parameters by introducing thermodynamic consistency. As a result, a wide range of properties can be computed in quantitative agreement with experiment, including densities, surface energies, solid–water interface tensions, anisotropies of interfacial energies of different crystal facets, adsorption energies of biomolecules, and thermal and mechanical properties. Applications include insight into the assembly of inorganic–organic multiphase materials, the recognition of inorganic facets by biomolecules, growth and shape preferences of nanocrystals and nanoparticles, as well as thermal transitions and nanomechanics. Limitations and opportunities for further development are also described.	2221.0
figshare	Both Configuration and QM Region Size Matter: Zinc Stability in QM/MM Models of DNA Methyltransferase	Quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical (QM/MM) methods are essential to the study of metalloproteins, but the relative importance of sampling and degree of QM treatment in achieving quantitative predictions is poorly understood. We study the relative magnitude of configurational and QM-region sensitivity of energetic and electronic properties in a representative Zn2+ metal binding site of a DNA methyltransferase. To quantify property variations, we analyze snapshots extracted from 250 ns of molecular dynamics simulation. To understand the degree of QM-region sensitivity, we perform analysis using QM regions ranging from a minimal 49-atom region consisting only of the Zn2+ metal and its four coordinating Cys residues up to a 628-atom QM region that includes residues within 12 Å of the metal center. Over the configurations sampled, we observe that illustrative properties (e.g., rigid Zn2+ removal energy) exhibit large fluctuations that are well captured with even minimal QM regions. Nevertheless, for both energetic and electronic properties, we observe a slow approach to asymptotic limits with similarly large changes in absolute values that converge only with larger (ca. 300-atom) QM region sizes. For the smaller QM regions, the electronic description of Zn2+ binding is incomplete: the metal binds too tightly and is too stabilized by the strong electrostatic potential of MM point charges, and the Zn–S bond covalency is overestimated. Overall, this work suggests that efficient sampling with QM/MM in small QM regions is an effective method to explore the influence of enzyme structure on target properties. At the same time, accurate descriptions of electronic and energetic properties require a larger QM region than the minimal metal-coordinating residues in order to converge treatment of both metal-local bonding and the overall electrostatic environment.	1983.0
figshare	Inclusion Complexation of Organic Micropollutants with β‑Cyclodextrin	Recently, β-cyclodextrin (βCD)-based polymers with enhanced adsorption kinetics and high removal capacity of organic micropollutants (OMPs) and uptake rates have been synthesized and tested experimentally. Although the exact physical–chemical mechanisms via which these polymers capture the various types of OMPs are not yet fully understood, it is suggested that the inclusion complex formation of OMPs with βCD is very important. In this study, the inclusion complex formation of OMPs with βCD in an aqueous solution is investigated by using the well-established attach–pull–release method in force field-based molecular dynamics simulations. A representative set of OMPs is selected based on the measured occurrences in surface and ground waters and the directives published by the European Union. To characterize the formation of the inclusion complex, the binding free energies, enthalpies, and entropies are computed and compared to experimental values. It is shown that computations using the q4md-CD/GAFF/Bind3P force field combination yield binding free energies that are in reasonable agreement with the experimental results for all OMPs studied. The binding enthalpies are decomposed into the main contributing interaction types. It is shown that, for all studied OMPs, the van der Waals interactions are favorable for the inclusion complexion and the hydrogen bond formation of the guest with the solvent and βCD plays a crucial role in the binding mechanism. Our findings show that MD simulations can adequately describe the inclusion complex formation of βCD with OMPs, which is the first step toward understanding the underlying mechanisms via which the βCD-based polymers capture OMPs.	1770.0
figshare	Intermolecular Interactions in G Protein-Coupled Receptor Allosteric Sites at the Membrane Interface from Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Quantum Chemical Calculations	Allosteric modulators are called promising candidates in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) drug development by displaying subtype selectivity and more specific receptor modulation. Among the allosteric sites known to date, cavities at the receptor–lipid interface represent an uncharacteristic binding location that raises many questions about the ligand interactions and stability, the binding site structure, and how all of these are affected by lipid molecules. In this work, we analyze interactions in the allosteric sites of the PAR2, C5aR1, and GCGR receptors in three lipid compositions using molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, we performed quantum chemical calculations involving the symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) and the natural population analysis to quantify the strength of intermolecular interactions. We show that besides classical hydrogen bonds, weak polar interactions such as O–HC, O–Br, and long-range electrostatics with the backbone amides contribute to the stability of allosteric modulators at the receptor–lipid interface. The allosteric cavities are detectable in various membrane compositions. The availability of polar atoms for interactions in such cavities can be assessed by water molecules from simulations. Although ligand–lipid interactions are weak, lipid tails play a role in ligand binding pose stability and the size of allosteric cavities. We discuss physicochemical aspects of ligand binding at the receptor–lipid interface and suggest a compound library enriched by weak donor groups for ligand search in such sites.	1750.0

figshare	Tetracycline Derivatives Inhibit Plasmodial Cysteine Protease Falcipain‑2 through Binding to a Distal Allosteric Site	Allosteric inhibitors regulate enzyme activity from remote and usually specific pockets. As they promise an avenue for less toxic and safer drugs, the identification and characterization of allosteric inhibitors has gained great academic and biomedical interest in recent years. Research on falcipain-2 (FP-2), the major papain-like cysteine hemoglobinase of Plasmodium falciparum, might benefit from this strategy to overcome the low selectivity against human cathepsins shown by active site-directed inhibitors. Encouraged by our previous finding that methacycline inhibits FP-2 noncompetitively, here we assessed other five tetracycline derivatives against this target and characterized their inhibition mechanism. As previously shown for methacycline, tetracycline derivatives inhibited FP-2 in a noncompetitive fashion, with Ki values ranging from 121 to 190 μM. A possible binding to the S′ side of the FP-2 active site, similar to that described by X-ray crystallography (PDB: 6SSZ) for the noncompetitive inhibitor E-chalcone 48 (EC48), was experimentally discarded by kinetic analysis using a large peptidyl substrate spanning the whole active site. By combining lengthy molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that allowed methacycline to diffuse from solution to different FP-2 surface regions and free energy calculations, we predicted the most likely binding mode of the ligand. Of note, the proposed binding pose explains the low differences in Ki values observed for the tested tetracycline derivatives and the calculated binding free energies match the experimental values. Overall, this study has implications for the design of novel allosteric inhibitors against FP-2 and sets the basis for further optimization of the tetracycline scaffold to produce more potent and selective inhibitors.	1920.0
figshare	Complexation of Lignin Dimers with β‑Cyclodextrin and Binding Stability Analysis by ESI-MS, Isothermal Titration Calorimetry, and Molecular Dynamics Simulations	Lignin derived from lignocellulosic biomass is the largest source of renewable bioaromatics present on earth and requires environmentally sustainable separation strategies to selectively obtain high-value degradation products. Applications of supramolecular interactions have the potential to isolate lignin compounds from biomass degradation fractions by the formation of variable inclusion complexes with cyclodextrins (CDs). CDs are commonly used as selective adsorbents for many applications and can capture guest molecules in their internal hydrophobic cavity. The strength of supramolecular interactions between CDs and lignin model compounds that represent potential lignocellulosic biomass degradation products can be characterized by assessing the thermodynamics of binding stability. Consequently, the inclusion interactions of β-CD and lignin model compounds G-(β-O-4′)-G, G-(β-O-4′)-truncG (guaiacylglycerol-β-guaiacyl ether), and G-(β–β′)-G (pinoresinol) were investigated empirically by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and isothermal titration calorimetry, complemented by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Empirical results indicate that there are substantial differences in binding stability dependent on the linkage type. The lignin model β–β′ dimer showed more potential bound states including 1:1, 2:1, and 1:2 (guest:host) complexation and, based on binding stability determinations, was consistently the most energetically favorable guest. Empirical results are supported by MD simulations that reveal that the capture of G-(β–β′)-G by β-CD is promising with a 66% probability of being bound for G-(β-O-4′)-truncG compared to 88% for G-(β–β′)-G (unbiased distance trajectory and explicit counting of bound states). These outcomes indicate CDs as a promising material to assist in separations of lignin oligomers from heterogeneous mixtures for the development of environmentally sustainable isolations of lignin compounds from biomass fractions.	2139.0
figshare	Mechanistic Characterization of Zeolite-Catalyzed Aromatic Electrophilic Substitution at Realistic Operating Conditions	Zeolite-catalyzed benzene ethylation is an important industrial reaction, as it is the first step in the production of styrene for polymer manufacturing. Furthermore, it is a prototypical example of aromatic electrophilic substitution, a key reaction in the synthesis of many bulk and fine chemicals. Despite extensive research, the reaction mechanism and the nature of elusive intermediates at realistic operating conditions is not properly understood. More in detail, the existence of the elusive arenium ion (better known as Wheland complex) formed upon electrophilic attack on the aromatic ring is still a matter of debate. Temperature effects and the presence of protic guest molecules such as water are expected to impact the reaction mechanism and lifetime of the reaction intermediates. Herein, we used enhanced sampling ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the complete mechanism of benzene ethylation with ethene and ethanol in the H-ZSM-5 zeolite. We show that both the stepwise and concerted mechanisms are active at reaction conditions and that the Wheland intermediate spontaneously appears as a shallow minimum in the free energy surface after the electrophilic attack on the benzene ring. Addition of water enhances the protonation kinetics by about 1 order of magnitude at coverages of one water molecule per Brønsted acidic site. In the fully solvated regime, an overstabilization of the BAS as hydronium ion occurs and the rate enhancement disappears. The obtained results give critical atomistic insights in the role of water to selectively tune the kinetics of protonation reactions in zeolites.	1754.0
figshare	Routine Microsecond Molecular Dynamics Simulations with AMBER on GPUs. 1. Generalized Born	We present an implementation of generalized Born implicit solvent all-atom classical molecular dynamics (MD) within the AMBER program package that runs entirely on CUDA enabled NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs). We discuss the algorithms that are used to exploit the processing power of the GPUs and show the performance that can be achieved in comparison to simulations on conventional CPU clusters. The implementation supports three different precision models in which the contributions to the forces are calculated in single precision floating point arithmetic but accumulated in double precision (SPDP), or everything is computed in single precision (SPSP) or double precision (DPDP). In addition to performance, we have focused on understanding the implications of the different precision models on the outcome of implicit solvent MD simulations. We show results for a range of tests including the accuracy of single point force evaluations and energy conservation as well as structural properties pertainining to protein dynamics. The numerical noise due to rounding errors within the SPSP precision model is sufficiently large to lead to an accumulation of errors which can result in unphysical trajectories for long time scale simulations. We recommend the use of the mixed-precision SPDP model since the numerical results obtained are comparable with those of the full double precision DPDP model and the reference double precision CPU implementation but at significantly reduced computational cost. Our implementation provides performance for GB simulations on a single desktop that is on par with, and in some cases exceeds, that of traditional supercomputers.	1767.0
figshare	Molecular Dynamics Investigation on the Effects of Protonation and Lysyl Hydroxylation on Sulfilimine Cross-links in Collagen IV	Collagen IV networks are an essential component of basement membranes that are important for their structural integrity and thus that of an organism’s tissues. Improper functioning of these networks has been associated with several diseases. Cross-links, such as sulfilimine bonds interconnecting NC1 domains, are critical for forming and mechanically stabilizing these collagen IV networks. More specifically, the sulfilimine cross-links form between methionine (Met93) and lysine/hydroxylsine (Lys211/Hyl211) residues of NC1 domains. Therefore, the dynamic nature of the sulfilimine bond in collagen IV is crucial for network formation. To understand the dynamic nature of a neutral and protonated sulfilimine bond in collagen IV, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on four sulfilimine cross-linked systems (i.e., Met93S–NLys211, Met93S–NHLys211+, Met93S–NHyl211, and Met93S–NHHyl211+) of collagen IV. The MD results showed that the neutral Met93S–NLys211 system has the smallest protein backbone and showed the cross-linked residues’ RMSD value. The conformational change analyses showed that the conformations of the sulfilimine cross-linked residues take on a U-shape for the Met93S–NHyl211 and Met93S–HNHyl211+ systems, whereas the conformations of the sulfilimine cross-linked residues are more open for the Met93S–NLys211, and Met93S–NHLys211+ systems. Protonation is a crucial biochemical process to stabilize the protein structure or the biological cross-links. Furthermore, the protonation of the sulfilimine bond could potentially influence hydrogen bond interaction with near amino acid residues, and according to water distribution analyses, the sulfilimine bond can potentially exist in one or more protonation states.	1875.0
figshare	Elucidation of Lipid Binding Sites on Lung Surfactant Protein A Using X‑ray Crystallography, Mutagenesis, and Molecular Dynamics Simulations	Surfactant protein A (SP-A) is a collagenous C-type lectin (collectin) that is critical for pulmonary defense against inhaled microorganisms. Bifunctional avidity of SP-A for pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as lipid A and for dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), the major component of surfactant membranes lining the air–liquid interface of the lung, ensures that the protein is poised for first-line interactions with inhaled pathogens. To improve our understanding of the motifs that are required for interactions with microbes and surfactant structures, we explored the role of the tyrosine-rich binding surface on the carbohydrate recognition domain of SP-A in the interaction with DPPC and lipid A using crystallography, site-directed mutagenesis, and molecular dynamics simulations. Critical binding features for DPPC binding include a three-walled tyrosine cage that binds the choline headgroup through cation−π interactions and a positively charged cluster that binds the phosphoryl group. This basic cluster is also critical for binding of lipid A, a bacterial PAMP and target for SP-A. Molecular dynamics simulations further predict that SP-A binds lipid A more tightly than DPPC. These results suggest that the differential binding properties of SP-A favor transfer of the protein from surfactant DPPC to pathogen membranes containing appropriate lipid PAMPs to effect key host defense functions.	1570.0

figshare	Diffusion Behavior of Methane in 3D Kerogen Models	As global energy demand increases, natural gas recovery from source rocks is attracting considerable attention since recent development in shale extraction techniques has made the recovery process economically viable. Kerogens are thought to play an important role in gas recovery; however, the interactions between trapped shale gas and kerogens remain poorly understood due to the complex, heterogeneous microporous structure of kerogens. This study examines the diffusive behavior of methane molecules in kerogen matrices of different types (Type I, II, and II) and maturity levels (A to D for Type II kerogens) on a molecular scale. Models of each kerogen type were developed using simulated annealing. We employed grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations to predict the methane loadings of the kerogen models and then used equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to compute the mean square displacement of methane molecules within the kerogen matrices under reservoir-relevant conditions, that is, 365 K and 275 bar. Our results show that methane self-diffusivity exhibits some degree of anisotropy in all kerogen types examined here except for Type I-A kerogens, where diffusion is the fastest and isotropic diffusion is observed. Self-diffusivity appears to correlate positively with pore volume for Type II kerogens, where an increase in diffusivity is observed with increasing maturity. Swelling of the kerogen matrix up to a 3% volume change is also observed upon methane adsorption. The findings contribute to a better understanding of hydrocarbon transport mechanisms in shale and may lead to further development of extraction techniques, fracturing fluids, and recovery predictions.	1747.0
figshare	Comparative in silico study of congocidine congeners as potential inhibitors of African swine fever virus	African swine fever virus (ASFV) infection is fatal in domesticated pigs, with a mortality rate approaching 100%. This may result in economic losses and threats to food security. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or antiviral therapies for ASFV. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated congocidine congeners and a tris-benzimidazole as potential inhibitors of ASFV transcription using an in silico approach. We applied redocking of congocidine and docking of its congeners and a tris-benzimidazole to a receptor containing B-DNA with AT-motifs as a target to mimic conserved ASFV late gene promoters. Subsequently, the binding scores of DNA-ligand docked complexes were evaluated and their binding affinity was estimated. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was then used to assess ligand behavior within the minor groove. From our results, it is evident the less toxic congocidine congeners and tris-benzimidazole could dock to AT-rich regions significantly. Additionally, the predicted binding affinities had suitable values comparable to other experimentally determined minor groove binders, MD simulation of the docked DNA-ligand complexes and subsequent molecular trajectory visualization further showed that the ligands remained embedded in the minor groove during the time course of simulation, indicating that these ligands may have potential applications in abrogating ASFV transcription.	1508.0
figshare	Small Molecule Hydration Free Energies in Explicit Solvent: An Extensive Test of Fixed-Charge Atomistic Simulations	Using molecular dynamics free energy simulations with TIP3P explicit solvent, we compute the hydration free energies of 504 neutral small organic molecules and compare them to experiments. We find, first, good general agreement between the simulations and the experiments, with an rms error of 1.24 kcal/mol over the whole set (i.e., about 2 kT) and a correlation coefficient of 0.89. Second, we use an automated procedure to identify systematic errors for some classes of compounds and suggest some improvements to the force field. We find that alkyne hydration free energies are particularly poorly predicted due to problems with a Lennard-Jones well depth and find that an alternate choice for this well depth largely rectifies the situation. Third, we study the nonpolar component of hydration free energiesthat is, the part that is not due to electrostatics. While we find that repulsive and attractive components of the nonpolar part both scale roughly with surface area (or volume) of the solute, the total nonpolar free energy does not scale with the solute surface area or volume, because it is a small difference between large components and is dominated by the deviations from the trend. While the methods used here are not new, this is a more extensive test than previous explicit solvent studies, and the size of the test set allows identification of systematic problems with force field parameters for particular classes of compounds. We believe that the computed free energies and components will be valuable to others in the future development of force fields and solvation models.	1713.0
figshare	Defining the mobility range of a hinge-type connection using molecular dynamics and metadynamics	A designed disulfide-rich β-hairpin peptide that dimerizes spontaneously served as a hinge-type connection between proteins. Here, we analyze the range of dynamics of this hinge dimer with the aim of proposing new applications for the DNA-encodable peptide and establishing guidelines for the computational analysis of other disulfide hinges. A recent structural analysis based on nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and ion mobility spectrometry revealed an averaged conformation in the hinge region which motivated us to investigate the dynamic behavior using a combination of molecular dynamics simulation, metadynamics and free energy surface analysis to characterize the conformational space available to the hinge. Principal component analysis uncovered two slow modes of the peptide, namely, the opening and closing motion and twisting of the two β-hairpins assembling the hinge. Applying a collective variable (CV) that mimics the first dominating mode, led to a major expansion of the conformational space. The description of the dynamics could be achieved by analysis of the opening angle and the twisting of the β-hairpins and, thus, offers a methodology that can also be transferred to other derivatives. It has been demonstrated that the hinge peptide’s lowest energy conformation consists of a large opening angle and strong twist but is separated by small energy barriers and can, thus, adopt a closed and untwisted structure. With the aim of proposing further applications for the hinge peptide, we simulated its behavior in the sterically congested environment of a four-helix bundle. Preliminary investigations show that one helix is pushed out and a three-helix bundle forms. The insights gained into the dynamics of the tetra-disulfide peptide and analytical guidelines developed in this study may contribute to the understanding of the structure and function of more complex hinge-type proteins, such as the IgG antibody family.	2049.0
figshare	Proton Transfer from a Photoacid to a Water Wire: First Principles Simulations and Fast Fluorescence Spectroscopy	Proton transfer reactions are ubiquitous in chemistry, especially in aqueous solutions. We investigate photoinduced proton transfer between the photoacid 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (HPTS) and water using fast fluorescence spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Photoexcitation causes rapid proton release from the HPTS hydroxyl. Previous experiments on HPTS/water described the progress from photoexcitation to proton diffusion using kinetic equations with two time constants. The shortest time constant has been interpreted as protonated and photoexcited HPTS evolving into an “associated” state, where the proton is “shared” between the HPTS hydroxyl and an originally hydrogen bonded water. The longer time constant has been interpreted as indicating evolution to a “solvent separated” state where the shared proton undergoes long distance diffusion. In this work, we refine the previous experimental results using very pure HPTS. We then use excited state ab initio molecular dynamics to elucidate the detailed molecular mechanism of aqueous excited state proton transfer in HPTS. We find that the initial excitation results in rapid rearrangement of water, forming a strong hydrogen bonded network (a “water wire”) around HPTS. HPTS then deprotonates in ≤3 ps, resulting in a proton that migrates back and forth along the wire before localizing on a single water molecule. We find a near linear relationship between the emission wavelength and proton-HPTS distance over the simulated time scale, suggesting that the emission wavelength can be used as a ruler for the proton distance. Our simulations reveal that the “associated” state corresponds to a water wire with a mobile proton and that the diffusion of the proton away from this water wire (to a generalized “solvent-separated” state) corresponds to the longest experimental time constant.	1992.0
figshare	Discovery of Self-Assembling π‑Conjugated Peptides by Active Learning-Directed Coarse-Grained Molecular Simulation	Electronically active organic molecules have demonstrated great promise as novel soft materials for energy harvesting and transport. Self-assembled nanoaggregates formed from π-conjugated oligopeptides composed of an aromatic core flanked by oligopeptide wings offer emergent optoelectronic properties within a water-soluble and biocompatible substrate. Nanoaggregate properties can be controlled by tuning core chemistry and peptide composition, but the sequence–structure–function relations remain poorly characterized. In this work, we employ coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations within an active learning protocol employing deep representational learning and Bayesian optimization to efficiently identify molecules capable of assembling pseudo-1D nanoaggregates with good stacking of the electronically active π-cores. We consider the DXXX-OPV3-XXXD oligopeptide family, where D is an Asp residue and OPV3 is an oligophenylenevinylene oligomer (1,4-distyrylbenzene), to identify the top performing XXX tripeptides within all 203 = 8000 possible sequences. By direct simulation of only 2.3% of this space, we identify molecules predicted to exhibit superior assembly relative to those reported in prior work. Spectral clustering of the top candidates reveals new design rules governing assembly. This work establishes new understanding of DXXX-OPV3-XXXD assembly, identifies promising new candidates for experimental testing, and presents a computational design platform that can be generically extended to other peptide-based and peptide-like systems.	1678.0
figshare	Molecular Structure and Permeability at the Interface between Phase-Separated Membrane Domains	Phase-separated membrane domains, also known as lipid rafts, are believed to play an important role in cell function. Although most rafts are sterol-enriched membrane regions, evidence suggests that living cells may also contain gel-like rafts. Interactions between gel and fluid domains have a large impact on membrane properties, as is the case with permeability. The membrane permeability may reach a peak at the main phase transition temperature, by far exceeding the values recorded at the fluid phase. It has been proposed that gel–fluid interfaces are leaky, but the effect has not yet been demonstrated at the molecular level. Here, we performed atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of phospholipid bilayers with coexisting gel-like and fluid domains. We found that the thickness mismatch between both phases, the membrane elasticity, and the lipid packing acted together to promote the formation of a thickness minimum at the gel–fluid interface. Free energy calculations showed that pore-mediated ionic permeation was strongly facilitated at the constriction region, whereas water permeation by simple diffusion was only marginally affected. Long-lived, peristaltic undulations were recorded at the bulk fluid phase near the main transition temperature. They gave rise to thickness minima that, although shallower than the interface constrictions, could also enhance permeability. Finally, we demonstrated that an interface constriction was also formed at the boundaries of regular, cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts. Our simulation results will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of biological processes such as transport, signaling, and cellular damage promoted by low temperature and dehydration.	1818.0
figshare	Atomistic Modeling of PEDOT:PSS Complexes II: Force Field Parameterization	The conductive polymer complex poly­(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is integral to many next-generation polymeric devices. All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) is increasingly employed to probe film microstructure, but the commonly used Generalized AMBER Force Field (GAFF) parameters remain unvalidated for this system. Here, we develop all-atom force fields for both undoped and highly doped PEDOT compatible with GAFF. Molecular geometries, vibrational energies, torsional profiles, and conformational energetics calculated with density functional theory comprise the training data. The optimized force fields improve upon GAFF for all the training data, including notable improvements in torsional barriers, and capture the finite size of charge carriers in doped PEDOT. Although GAFF predicts similar behavior between undoped and doped polymers, our models identify meaningful differences in ground-state geometry, vibrational spectra, and torsional barriers between the two. Furthermore, vacuum MD simulations show that the neutral polymer is more flexible than the highly doped polymer, primarily due to the weaker inter-monomer dihedral potentials. The foregoing trends are directly attributable to the aromatic-to-quinoid transition PEDOT experiences upon doping. This coupling between doping and molecular flexibility highlights the importance of charge–geometry interactions in atomistic modeling and should be considered while modeling conjugated polymers beyond PEDOT.	1582.0
figshare	On the Possibility That Bond Strain Is the Mechanism of RING E3 Activation in the E2-Catalyzed Ubiquitination Reaction	Ubiquitination is a type of post-translational modification wherein the small protein ubiquitin (Ub) is covalently bound to a lysine on a target protein. Ubiquitination can signal for several regulatory pathways including protein degradation. Ubiquitination occurs by a series of reactions catalyzed by three types of enzymes: ubiquitin activating enzymes, E1; ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, E2; and ubiquitin ligases, E3. E2 enzymes directly catalyze the transfer of Ub to the target proteinthe RING E3 improves the efficiency. Prior to its transfer, Ub is covalently linked to the E2 via a thioester bond and the Ub∼E2 conjugate forms a quaternary complex with the RING E3. It is hypothesized that the RING E3 improves the catalytic efficiency of ubiquitination by placing the E2∼Ub conjugate in a “closed” position, which tensions and weakens the thioester bond. We interrogate this hypothesis by analyzing the strain on the thioester during molecular dynamics simulations of both open and closed E2∼Ub/E3 complexes. Our data indicate that the thioester is strained when the E2∼Ub conjugate is in the closed position. We also show that the amount of strain is consistent with the experimental rate enhancement caused by the RING E3. Finally, our simulations show that the closed configuration increases the populations of key hydrogen bonds in the E2∼Ub active site. This is consistent with another hypothesis stating that the RING E3 enhances reaction rates by preorganizing the substrates.	1613.0
figshare	Interaction of Hematoporphyrin with Lipid Membranes	Natural or synthetic porphyrins are being used as photosensitizers in photodiagnosis (PD) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) of malignancies and some other diseases. Understanding the interactions between porphyrins and cell membranes is therefore important to rationalize the uptake of photosensitizers and their passive transport through cell membranes. In this study, we consider the properties of hematoporphyrin (Hp), a well-known photosensitizer for PD and PDT, in the presence of a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) bilayer that we use as a model system for protein-free cell membranes. For this purpose, we employed 200 ns atomic-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for five systems containing the neutral (Hp0) or the dianionic form (Hp2–) of Hp and the POPC bilayer. MD simulations allowed one to estimate the position, orientation, and dynamics of Hp molecules inside the membrane. The dye molecules were found to reside in the phospholipid headgroup area close to the carbonyl groups of the POPC acyl chains. Their orientations were dependent on the protonation state of two propionic groups. Hp2– was found to have a lower affinity to enter the membrane than the neutral form. The dianions, being in the aqueous phase, formed stable dimers with a strictly determined geometry. Our results fully supported the experimental data and provide a more detailed molecular-level description of the interactions of photosensitizers with lipid membranes.	1532.0
figshare	Steered molecular dynamics simulations reveal critical residues for (un)binding of substrates, inhibitors and a product to the malarial M1 aminopeptidase	Malaria is a life-threatening disease spread by mosquitoes. Plasmodium falciparum M1 alanyl aminopeptidase (PfM1-AAP) is a promising target for the treatment of malaria. The recently solved crystal structures of PfM1-AAP revealed that the buried active site can be accessed through two channel openings: a short N-terminal channel with the length of 8 Å and a long C-terminal channel with the length of 30 Å. It is unclear, however, how substrates and inhibitors migrate to the active site and a product of cleavage leaves. Here, we study the molecular mechanism of substrate and inhibitor migration to the active site and the product release using steered molecular dynamics simulations. We identified a stepwise passage of substrates and inhibitors in the C-terminal channel of PfM1-AAP, involving (I) ligand recognition at the opening of the channel, (II) ionic translation to the ‘water reservoir’, (III) ligand reorientation in the ‘water reservoir’ and (IV) passage in a suitable conformation into the active site. Endorsed by enzymatic analysis of functional recombinant PfM1-AAP and mutagenesis studies, our novel ligand-residue binding network analysis has identified the functional residues controlling ligand migration within the C-terminal channel of PfM1-AAP. Furthermore, from unbinding simulations of the Arg product we propose a charge repulsion as the driving force to expel the product out from the N-terminal channel of PfM1-AAP. Our work paves the way towards the design of a novel class of PfM1-AAP inhibitors based on preventing substrate entry to the active site.	1739.0
figshare	Uranyl–Glutardiamidoxime Binding from First-Principles Molecular Dynamics, Classical Molecular Dynamics, and Free-Energy Simulations	Exploring the structural interplay of ligands with uranyl can provide important knowledge for technology advances in uranium extraction from seawater. However, obtaining such chemical information is not an easy endeavor experimentally. From a plethora of computational methods, this work provides both microscopic insights and free-energy profiles of the binding between uranyl and deprotonated glutardiamidoxime (H2B) for which experimental structural information is not available, despite H2B being an important model ligand with an open-chain conformation for understanding aqueous uranium extraction chemistry. In our molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we explicitly accounted for the water solvent as well as the Na+ and Cl– ions. We found that hydrogen bonding plays a critical role in dictating the binding configurations of B2– and HB– with uranyl. Simulated free energies of sequential ligand binding to form UO2B, [UO2B2]2–, and [UO2(HB)­B]− show very good agreement with the experimental values, lending support to our structural insights. The potential of mean force simulations showed the common feature of an important intermediate state where one end of the ligand binds to uranyl while the other end is solvated in water. Bringing the loose end of the ligand to bind with uranyl has a free-energy barrier of 15–25 kJ/mol. The present work shows that the combined simulation approach can reveal key structural and thermodynamic insights toward a better understanding of aqueous complexation chemistry for uranium extraction from the sea.	1686.0
figshare	Benchmarking of Molecular Dynamics Force Fields for Solid–Liquid and Solid–Solid Phase Transitions in Alkanes	Accurate prediction of alkane phase transitions involving solids is needed to prevent catastrophic pipeline blockages, improve lubrication formulations, smart insulation, and energy storage, as well as bring fundamental understanding to processes such as artificial morphogenesis. However, simulation of these transitions is challenging and therefore often omitted in force field development. Here, we perform a series of benchmarks on seven representative molecular dynamics models (TraPPE, PYS, CHARMM36, L-OPLS, COMPASS, Williams, and the newly optimized Williams 7B), comparing with experimental data for liquid properties, liquid–solid, and solid–solid phase transitions of two prototypical alkanes, n-pentadecane (C15) and n-hexadecane (C16). We find that existing models overestimate the melting points by up to 34 K, with PYS and Williams 7B yielding the most accurate results deviating only 2 and 3 K from the experiment. We specially design order parameters to identify crystal–rotator phase transitions in alkanes. United-atom models could only produce a rotator phase with complete rotational disorder, whereas all-atom models using a 12-6 Lennard-Jones potential show no rotator phase even when superheated above the melting point. In contrast, Williams (Buckingham potential) and COMPASS (9-6 Lennard-Jones) reproduce the crystal-to-rotator phase transition, with the optimized Williams 7B model having the most accurate crystal–rotator transition temperature of C15.	1590.0
figshare	Adsorption Behavior of Hydrophobin Proteins on Polydimethylsiloxane Substrates	The design of a bioactive surface with appropriate wettability for effective protein immobilization has attracted much attention. Previous experiments showed that the adsorption of hydrophobic protein HFBI onto a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate surface can reverse the inherent hydrophobicity of the surface, hence making it suitable for immobilization of a secondary protein. In this study, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations have been conducted to elucidate the adsorption mechanism of HFBI on the PDMS substrate in an aqueous environment. Nine independent simulations starting from three representative initial orientations of HFBI toward the solid surface were performed, resulting in different adsorption modes. The main secondary structures of the protein in each mode are found to be preserved in the entire course of adsorption due to the four disulfide bonds. The relative binding free energies of the different adsorption modes were calculated, showing that the mode, in which the binding residues of HFBI fully come from its hydrophobic patch, is most energetically favored. In this favorable binding mode, the hydrophilic region of HFBI is fully exposed to water, leading to a high hydrophilicity of the modified PDMS surface, consistent with experiments. Furthermore, a set of residues consisting of Leu12, Leu24, Leu26, Ile27, Ala66, and Leu68 were found to play an important role in the adsorption of HFBI on different hydrophobic substrates, irrespective of the structural features of the substrates.	1606.0
figshare	Absorption of Phosphonium Cations and Dications into a Hydrated POPC Phospholipid Bilayer: A Computational Study	Molecular dynamics (MD) based on an empirical force field is applied to investigate the effect of phosphonium cations ([P6,6,6,6]+) and geminal dications ([DxC10]2+) inserted at T = 300 K into the hydration layer separating planar POPC phospholipid bilayers. Up to high concentration, nearly every added cation and dication becomes absorbed into the lipid phase. Absorption takes place during several microseconds and is virtually irreversible. The neutralizing counterions ([Cl]−, in the present simulation) remain dissolved in water, giving origin to the charge separation and the strong electrostatic double layer at the water/lipid interface. Incorporation of cations and dications changes the properties of the lipid bilayer such as diffusion, viscosity, and the electrostatic pattern. At high ionic concentration, the bilayer acquires a long-wavelength standing undulation, corresponding to a change of phase from fluid planar to ripple. All these changes are potentially able to affect processes relevant in the context of cell biology. The major difference between cations and dications concerns the kinetics of absorption, which takes place nearly two times faster in the [P6,6,6,6]+ case, and for [DxC10]2+ dications displays a marked separation into two-stages, corresponding to the easy absorption of the first phosphonium head of the dication and the somewhat more activated absorption of the second phosphonium head of each dication.	1559.0
figshare	Adding Anisotropy to the Standard Quasi-Harmonic Approximation Still Fails in Several Ways to Capture Organic Crystal Thermodynamics	We evaluate the accuracy of varying thermal expansion models for the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) relative to molecular dynamics (MD) for 10 sets of enantiotropic organic polymorphs. Relative to experiment we find that MD, using an off-the-shelf point charge potential, gets the sign of the enthalpic contributions correct for 6 of the 10 pairs of polymorphs and the sign of the entropic contributions correct for all pairs. We find that anisotropic QHA provides little improvement to the error in free energy differences from MD relative to isotropic QHA, but does a better job capturing the thermal expansion of the crystals. A form of entropy–enthalpy compensation allows the free energy differences of QHA to deviate less than 0.1 kcal/mol from MD for most polymorphic pairs, despite errors up to 0.4 kcal/mol in the entropy and enthalpy. Deviations in the free energy of QHA and MD do not clearly correlate with molecular flexibility, clarifying a previously published finding. Much of the error previously found between QHA and MD for these flexible molecules is reduced when QHA is run from a lattice minimum consistent with the same basin as MD, rather than the energy-minimized experimental crystal structure. Specifically, performing anisotropic QHA on lattice minimum quenched from low-temperature replica exchange simulations reduced the error previously found by 0.2 kcal/mol on average. However, these conformationally flexible molecules can have many low-temperature conformational minima, and the choice of an inconsistent minima causes free energies estimated from QHA to deviate from MD at temperatures as low as 10 K. We also find finite size errors in the polymorph free energy differences using anisotropic QHA, with free energy differences as large as 0.5 kcal/mol between unit and supercells loosely correlated with differences in anisotropic thermal expansion. These larger system sizes are computationally more accessible using our cheaper 1D variant of anisotropic QHA, which gives free energies within 0.02 kcal/mol of the fully anisotropic approach at all temperatures studied. The errors between MD and experiment are 1–2 orders of magnitude larger than those seen between QHA and MD, so the quality of the force field used is still of primary concern, but this study illustrates a number of other important factors that must be considered to obtain quantitative organic crystal thermodynamics.	2561.0
figshare	Recognition and Binding of RsmE to an AGGAC Motif of RsmZ: Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulations	CsrA/RsmE is a post-transcriptional regulator protein widely distributed in bacteria. It impedes the expression of target mRNAs by attaching their 5′ untranslated region. The translation is restored by small, noncoding RNAs that sequester CsrA/RsmE acting as sponges. In both cases, the protein recognizes and attaches to specific AGGAX and AXGGAX motifs, where X refers to any nucleotide. RsmZ of Pseudomonas protegens is one of these small RNAs. The structures of some of its complexes with RsmE were disclosed a few years ago. We have used umbrella sampling simulations to force the unbinding of RsmE from the AGGAC motif located in the single-stranded region sited between stem loops 2 and 3 of RsmZ. The calculations unveiled the identity of the main residues and nucleotides involved in the process. They also showed that the region adopts a hairpin-like conformation during the initial stages of the binding. The ability to acquire this conformation requires that the region has a length of at least nine nucleotides. Besides, we performed standard molecular dynamics simulations of the isolated fragments, analyzed their typical conformations, and characterized their movements. This analysis revealed that the free molecules oscillate along specific collective coordinates that facilitate the initial stages of the binding. The results strongly suggest that the flexibility of the single-stranded region of RsmZ crucially affects the ability of its binding motif to catch RsmE.	1589.0
figshare	Extending the Stochastic Titration CpHMD to CHARMM36m	The impact of pH on proteins is significant but often neglected in molecular dynamics simulations. Constant-pH Molecular Dynamics (CpHMD) is the state-of-the-art methodology to deal with these effects. However, it still lacks widespread adoption by the scientific community. The stochastic titration CpHMD is one of such methods that, until now, only supported the GROMOS force field family. Here, we extend this method’s implementation to include the CHARMM36m force field available in the GROMACS software package. We test this new implementation with a diverse group of proteins, namely, lysozyme, Staphylococcal nuclease, and human and E. coli thioredoxins. All proteins were conformationally stable in the simulations, even at extreme pH values. The RMSE values (pKa prediction vs experimental) obtained were very encouraging, in particular for lysozyme and human thioredoxin. We have also identified a few residues that challenged the CpHMD simulations, highlighting scenarios where the method still needs improvement independently of the force field. The CHARMM36m all-atom implementation was more computationally efficient when compared with the GROMOS 54A7, taking advantage of a shorter nonbonded interaction cutoff and a less frequent neighboring list update. The new extension will allow the study of pH effects in many systems for which this force field is particularly suited, i.e., proteins, membrane proteins, lipid bilayers, and nucleic acids.	1513.0
figshare	Study of Interaction Between PEG Carrier and Three Relevant Drug Molecules: Piroxicam, Paclitaxel, and Hematoporphyrin	Molecular dynamics simulation has been used to study the specific interactions between poly­(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and three drug molecules for which PEG is used to aid delivery: paclitaxel and piroxicam, where PEG is a carrier agent, and hematoporphyrin, where PEG is covalently attached to form a “stealth shield”. Simulating at physiological salt concentration, we found no evidence of any specific interaction between paclitaxel or piroxicam with PEG, but found a strong interaction for the case of hematoporphyrin. This interaction is lipophilic in nature, between the nonpolar (CH2)2 groups of the PEG and the porphin ring of the hematoporphyrin. This interaction was found to be strong enough that the PEG aggregated to the hematoporphyrin, independent of whether or not it was covalently bound. Interestingly, when the simulation was repeated in absence of salt we found evidence of this interaction being weakened. This led us to hypothesize a previously unforeseen mechanism: interaction with salt cations cause the PEG to coil around the salt ions, each ion binding to many PEG oxygens, increasing the exposure of the nonpolar ethylene groups, thus increasing the effective hydrophobicity of PEG. The Hydrophobic ethylene groups of the PEG chains adhere strongly to the hydrophobic porphin ring. Experiments involving absorption spectra measurements were conducted, and these results also indicated that presence of salt at physiological level increases the effective attractive interaction between PEG and hematoporphyrin. Taken together, our results demonstrate that while PEG, due to its solubility in both polar and nonpolar solvents, may act as a dissolution aid for paclitaxel and piroxicam, of the three drug molecules studied it will only have a protective role for the case of the hematoporphyrin.	1936.0
figshare	Comprehensive Computational Analysis Exploring the Formation of Caprolactam-Based Deep Eutectic Solvents and Their Applications in Natural Gas Desulfurization	Several deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have been recently developed for extraction of hydrogen sulfide from natural gas. Among these newly designed DESs, a combination of caprolactam and tetrabutylammonium halides at a molar ratio of 1:1, as the DESs, has the highest desulfurization efficiencies. In this work, we explored the formation of caprolactam-based DESs using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and ab initio computations. The results, based on the time average of the equilibrated production run of MD simulations, revealed ∼15% decrease in the ionic interactions of tetrabutylammonium halides and, more interestingly, ∼92% decrease in the hydrogen bonds between caprolactam, thereby explaining the strong depression in the melting point observed in experiments during the formation of the DES. Next, simulations of the DES with mixtures of methane and hydrogen sulfide were performed to mimic the natural gas desulfurization process. Efficient absorption of hydrogen sulfide from natural gas under different operating conditions (5000 and 10,000 ppm H2S, at 25 and 60 °C, and at 1 and 10 bar) can be observed from the simulations. The results further unveiled strong interactions between the anions of the DESs and hydrogen sulfide, with interaction energies 10-fold higher than those of methane/hydrogen sulfide, explaining the mechanism of desulfurization by these DESs. Additionally, two different DESs composed of monoethanolamines/methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide and urea/choline chloride were used to evaluate and compare their capacity to absorb hydrogen sulfide; however, we observed that the caprolactam-based DESs are highly efficient, particularly at low temperatures, low pressures, and low fuel/DES mole ratios. As the existing literature covers only experiments on the removal of hydrogen sulfide via the DESs, the simulations presented herein provide insights into the mechanism of absorption, thereby paving a way forward for better design of the DESs.	2141.0
figshare	Upgrading and Validation of the AMBER Force Field for Histidine and Cysteine Zinc(II)-Binding Residues in Sites with Four Protein Ligands	We developed and validated a novel force field in the context of the AMBER parameterization for the simulation of zinc­(II)-binding proteins. The proposed force field assumes nonbonded spherical interactions between the central zinc­(II) and the coordinating residues. A crucial innovative aspect of our approach is to account for the polarization effects of the cation by redefining the atomic charges of the coordinating residues and an adjustment of Lennard-Jones parameters of Zn-interacting atoms to reproduce mean distance distributions. The optimal transferable parametrization was obtained by performing accurate quantum mechanical calculations on a training set of high-quality protein structures, encompassing the most common folds of zinc­(II) sites. The addressed sites contain a zinc­(II) ion tetra-coordinated by histidine and cysteine residues and represent about 70% of all physiologically relevant zinc­(II) sites in the Protein Data Bank. Molecular dynamics simulations with explicit solvent, carried out on several zinc­(II)-binding proteins not included in the training set, show that our model for zinc­(II) sites preserves the tetra-coordination of the metal site with remarkable stability, yielding zinc­(II)–X mean distances similar to experimental data. Finally, the model was tested by evaluating the zinc­(II)-binding affinities, using the alchemical free energy perturbation approach. The calculated dissociation constants correlate satisfactorily with the experimental counterpart demonstrating the validity and transferability of the proposed parameterization for zinc­(II)-binding proteins.	1758.0
figshare	Generation of Quantum Configurational Ensembles Using Approximate Potentials	Conformational analysis is of paramount importance in drug design: it is crucial to determine pharmacological properties, understand molecular recognition processes, and characterize the conformations of ligands when unbound. Molecular Mechanics (MM) simulation methods, such as Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD), are usually employed to generate ensembles of structures due to their ability to extensively sample the conformational space of molecules. The accuracy of these MM-based schemes strongly depends on the functional form of the force field (FF) and its parametrization, components that often hinder their performance. High-level methods, such as ab initio MD, provide reliable structural information but are still too computationally expensive to allow for extensive sampling. Therefore, to overcome these limitations, we present a multilevel MC method that is capable of generating quantum configurational ensembles while keeping the computational cost at a minimum. We show that FF reparametrization is an efficient route to generate FFs that reproduce QM results more closely, which, in turn, can be used as low-cost models to achieve the gold standard QM accuracy. We demonstrate that the MC acceptance rate is strongly correlated with various phase space overlap measurements and that it constitutes a robust metric to evaluate the similarity between the MM and QM levels of theory. As a more advanced application, we present a self-parametrizing version of the algorithm, which combines sampling and FF parametrization in one scheme, and apply the methodology to generate the QM/MM distribution of a ligand in aqueous solution.	1731.0
figshare	Studies of the Mechanism of Selectivity of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) Bidentate Inhibitors Using Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Free Energy Calculations	Bidentate inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) are considered as a group of ideal inhibitors with high binding potential and high selectivity in treating type II diabetes. In this paper, the binding models of five bidentate inhibitors to PTP1B, TCPTP, and SHP-2 were investigated and compared by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy calculations. The binding free energies were computed using the Molecular Mechanics/Poisson−Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) methodology. The calculation results show that the predicted free energies of the complexes are well consistent with the experimental data. The Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) free energy decomposition analysis indicates that the residues ARG24, ARG254, and GLN262 in the second binding site of PTP1B are essential for the high selectivity of inhibitors. Furthermore, the residue PHE182 close to the active site is also important for the selectivity and the binding affinity of the inhibitors. According to our analysis, it can be concluded that in most cases the polarity of the portion of the inhibitor that binds to the second binding site of the protein is positive to the affinity of the inhibitors while negative to the selectivity of the inhibitors. We expect that the information we obtained here can help to develop potential PTP1B inhibitors with more promising specificity.	1577.0
figshare	Extension of the Highly Mobile Membrane Mimetic to Transmembrane Systems through Customized in Silico Solvents	The mechanics of the protein–lipid interactions of transmembrane proteins are difficult to capture with conventional atomic molecular dynamics, due to the slow lateral diffusion of lipids restricting sampling to states near the initial membrane configuration. The highly mobile membrane mimetic (HMMM) model accelerates lipid dynamics by modeling the acyl tails nearest to the membrane center as a fluid organic solvent while maintaining an atomic description of the lipid headgroups and short acyl tails. The HMMM has been applied to many peripheral protein systems; however, the organic solvent used to date caused deformations in transmembrane proteins by intercalating into the protein and disrupting interactions between individual side chains. We ameliorate the effect of the solvent on transmembrane protein structure through the development of two new in silico Lennard-Jones solvents. The parameters for the new solvents were determined through an extensive parameter search in order to match the bulk properties of alkanes in a highly simplified model. Using these new solvents, we substantially improve the insertion free energy profiles of 10 protein side chain analogues across the entire bilayer. In addition, we reduce the intercalation of solvent into transmembrane systems, resulting in native-like transmembrane protein structures from five different topological classes within a HMMM bilayer. The parametrization of the solvents, in addition to their computed physical properties, is discussed. By combining high lipid lateral diffusion with intact transmembrane proteins, we foresee the developed solvents being useful to efficiently identify membrane composition inhomogeneities and lipid binding caused by the presence of membrane proteins.	1872.0
figshare	Influence of Organic Structure-Directing Agents on Fluoride Dynamics in As-Synthesized Silicalite‑1	Silicalite-1, an all-silica zeolite having the MFI topology, can be synthesized in the presence of fluoride ions, which balance the charge of the cationic organic structure-directing agents (OSDAs; such as tetrapropylammonium). In as-synthesized Silicalite-1, the fluoride anions occupy well-defined positions in the 41·52·62 cages where they are covalently bonded to framework Si atoms. Previous experimental studies showed that the fluoride anions are dynamically disordered at room temperature. The dynamic disorder can be suppressed by cooling to cryogenic temperatures and also through a variation of the OSDA, pointing to an interplay between framework and extra framework dynamics. In the present work, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations in the framework of density functional theory (DFT) were employed to study the influence of the OSDA on the fluoride dynamics, comparing a total of eight alkylammonium OSDAs having either four alkyl chains of equal length (symmetric) or one short and three longer chains (asymmetric). In addition to time-averaged quantities, such as atomic root mean square displacements, the number of dynamic events in which fluoride ions “jump” from one Si atom to a neighboring one was analyzed. While the timescale accessible to the AIMD simulations was found to be too short to observe significant fluoride dynamic disorder at room temperature, it was clearly detectable when increasing the temperature to 373 K. For systems incorporating symmetric OSDAs, increasing the OSDA size correlated with decreasing freedom of motion of the framework atoms. In line with previous experimental findings, a drastic reduction of the fluoride dynamic disorder was observed for systems containing tributylammonium-based OSDAs having one short (methyl or ethyl) chain. Besides reproducing the experimental observations, the computational approach also helped to explain this suppression of the dynamic disorder on the basis of the size and shape of the OSDA.	2091.0
figshare	CelS-Catalyzed Processive Cellulose Degradation and Cellobiose Extraction for the Production of Bioethanol	Bacterial cellulase enzymes are potent candidates for the efficient production of bioethanol, a promising alternative to fossil fuels, from cellulosic biomass. These enzymes catalyze the breakdown of cellulose in plant biomass into simple sugars and then to bioethanol. In the absence of the enzyme, the cellulosic biomass is recalcitrant to decomposition due to fermentation-resistant lignin and pectin coatings on the cellulose surface, which make them inaccessible for hydrolysis. Cellobiohydrolase CelS is a microbial enzyme that binds to cellulose fiber and efficiently cleaves it into a simple sugar (cellobiose) by a repeated processive chopping mechanism. The two contributing factors to the catalytic reaction rate and the yield of cellobiose are the efficient product expulsion from the product binding site of CelS and the movement of the substrate or cellulose chain into the active site. Despite progress in understanding product expulsion in other cellulases, much remains to be understood about the molecular mechanism of processive action of these enzymes. Here, nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations using suitable reaction coordinates are carried out to investigate the energetics and mechanism of the substrate dynamics and product expulsion in CelS. The calculated free energy barrier for the product expulsion is three times lower than that for the processive action indicating that product removal is relatively easier and faster than the sliding of the substrate to the catalytic active site. The water traffic near the active site in response to the product expulsion and the processive action is also explored.	1749.0

figshare	Improving All-Atom Force Field to Accurately Describe DNA G‑Quadruplex Loops	The DNA G-quadruplex (GQ) displays structural polymorphisms, and interactions between its loops and flanking sequences critically determine which of the diverse GQ conformers is adopted. All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of GQs are computationally challenging due to slow folding times and force field (ff) artifacts. In an earlier study, a direct folding simulation of the simplest DNA GQ (TBA15) was first reported using a modified version of the AMBER bsc1 ff (bsc1_vdW ff). Despite this successful folding simulation, it was later found that the bsc1_vdW ff is somewhat limited in terms of describing loop structures of GQs, which is problematic because GQ loop regions play key roles in ligand binding to modulate GQ activities. In this study, we further modified the bsc1_vdW ff to enhance the GQ loop prediction by fine-tuning a limited number of van der Waals (vdW) parameters of the standard AMBER bsc1 ff to improve the GQ loop distribution of a target GQ system (three-layered antiparallel GQ; mHtel21). Test simulations of this newly generated ff (bsc1_vdWL ff) on DNA GQs with diverse topologies (hybrid1, hybrid2, and parallel propeller) revealed that loop structures were predicted more accurately than by the bsc1_vdW ff. We consider that enhanced sampling MD simulation methods in combination with bsc1_vdWL provide useful simulation protocols for resolving outstanding issues of DNA GQ folding and GQ/ligand binding at the all-atom level.	1543.0
figshare	Data_Sheet_2_Spontaneous Membrane Nanodomain Formation in the Absence or Presence of the Neurotransmitter Serotonin.ZIP	Detailed knowledge on the formation of biomembrane domains, their structure, composition, and physical characteristics is scarce. Despite its frequently discussed importance in signaling, e.g., in obtaining localized non-homogeneous receptor compositions in the plasma membrane, the nanometer size as well as the dynamic and transient nature of domains impede their experimental characterization. In turn, atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combine both, high spatial and high temporal resolution. Here, using microsecond atomistic MD simulations, we characterize the spontaneous and unbiased formation of nano-domains in a plasma membrane model containing phosphatidylcholine (POPC), palmitoyl-sphingomyelin (PSM), and cholesterol (Chol) in the presence or absence of the neurotransmitter serotonin at different temperatures. In the ternary mixture, highly ordered and highly disordered domains of similar composition coexist at 303 K. The distinction of domains by lipid acyl chain order gets lost at lower temperatures of 298 and 294 K, suggesting a phase transition at ambient temperature. By comparison of domain ordering and composition, we demonstrate how the domain-specific binding of the neurotransmitter serotonin results in a modified domain lipid composition and a substantial downward shift of the phase transition temperature. Our simulations thus suggest a novel mode of action of neurotransmitters possibly of importance in neuronal signal transmission.	1600.0
figshare	Force Field for Water over Pt(111): Development, Assessment, and Comparison	Metal/water interfaces are key in many natural and industrial processes, such as corrosion, atmospheric, or environmental chemistry. Even today, the only practical approach to simulate large interfaces between a metal and water is to perform force-field simulations. In this work, we propose a novel force field, GAL17, to describe the interaction of water and a Pt(111) surface. GAL17 builds on three terms: (i) a standard Lennard-Jones potential for the bonding interaction between the surface and water, (ii) a Gaussian term to improve the surface corrugation, and (iii) two terms describing the angular dependence of the interaction energy. The 12 parameters of this force field are fitted against a set of 210 adsorption geometries of water on Pt(111). The performance of GAL17 is compared to several other approaches that have not been validated against extensive first-principles computations yet. Their respective accuracy is evaluated on an extended set of 802 adsorption geometries of H2O on Pt(111), 52 geometries derived from icelike layers, and an MD simulation of an interface between a c(4 × 6) Pt(111) surface and a water layer of 14 Å thickness. The newly developed GAL17 force field provides a significant improvement over previously existing force fields for Pt(111)/H2O interactions. Its well-balanced performance suggests that it is an ideal candidate to generate relevant geometries for the metal/water interface, paving the way to a representative sampling of the equilibrium distribution at the interface and to predict solvation free energies at the solid/liquid interface.	1673.0
figshare	Insight into the Intermolecular Recognition Mechanism between Keap1 and IKKβ Combining Homology Modelling, Protein-Protein Docking, Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Virtual Alanine Mutation	Degradation of certain proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is a common strategy taken by the key modulators responsible for stress responses. Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1(Keap1), a substrate adaptor component of the Cullin3 (Cul3)-based ubiquitin E3 ligase complex, mediates the ubiquitination of two key modulators, NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and IκB kinase β (IKKβ), which are involved in the redox control of gene transcription. However, compared to the Keap1-Nrf2 protein-protein interaction (PPI), the intermolecular recognition mechanism of Keap1 and IKKβ has been poorly investigated. In order to explore the binding pattern between Keap1 and IKKβ, the PPI model of Keap1 and IKKβ was investigated. The structure of human IKKβ was constructed by means of the homology modeling method and using reported crystal structure of Xenopus laevis IKKβ as the template. A protein-protein docking method was applied to develop the Keap1-IKKβ complex model. After the refinement and visual analysis of docked proteins, the chosen pose was further optimized through molecular dynamics simulations. The resulting structure was utilized to conduct the virtual alanine mutation for the exploration of hot-spots significant for the intermolecular interaction. Overall, our results provided structural insights into the PPI model of Keap1-IKKβ and suggest that the substrate specificity of Keap1 depend on the interaction with the key tyrosines, namely Tyr525, Tyr574 and Tyr334. The study presented in the current project may be useful to design molecules that selectively modulate Keap1. The selective recognition mechanism of Keap1 with IKKβ or Nrf2 will be helpful to further know the crosstalk between NF-κB and Nrf2 signaling. 	1938.0
figshare	Structure and Dynamics of Dioleoyl-Phosphatidylcholine Bilayers under the Influence of Quercetin and Rutin	Quercetin and rutin, two widely studied flavonoids with applications foreseen in the sectors of pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, have been chosen as model compounds for a detailed structural and dynamical investigation onto their influence on fluid lipid bilayers. Combining global small angle X-ray scattering analysis with molecular dynamics, various changes in the properties of dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayers have been determined. The solubility of quercetin in DOPC membranes is assured up to 12 mol %, whereas rutin, with additional glucose and rhamnose groups, are fully soluble only up to 6 mol %. Both flavonoids induce an increase in membrane undulations and thin the bilayers slightly (<1 Å) in a concentration dependent manner, wherein quercetin shows a stronger effect. Concomitantly, in the order of 2–4%, the adjacent bilayer distance increases with the flavonoid’s concentration. Partial molecular areas of quercetin and rutin are determined to be 26 and 51 Å2, respectively. Simulated averaged areas per molecule confirm these estimates. A 60° tilted orientation of quercetin is observed with respect to the bilayer normal, whereas the flavonoid moiety of rutin is oriented more perpendicular (α-angle 30°) to the membrane surface. Both flavonoid moieties are located at a depth of 12 and 16 Å for quercetin and rutin, respectively, while their anionic forms display a location closer to the polar interface. Finally, at both simulated concentrations (1.5 and 12 mol %), DOPC–rutin systems induce a stronger packing of the pure DOPC lipid bilayer, mainly due to stronger attractive electrostatic interactions in the polar lipid head region.	1784.0
figshare	Structural Refinement of Proteins by Restrained Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Non-interacting Molecular Fragments	The knowledge of multiple conformational states is a prerequisite to understand the function of membrane transport proteins. Unfortunately, the determination of detailed atomic structures for all these functionally important conformational states with conventional high-resolution approaches is often difficult and unsuccessful. In some cases, biophysical and biochemical approaches can provide important complementary structural information that can be exploited with the help of advanced computational methods to derive structural models of specific conformational states. In particular, functional and spectroscopic measurements in combination with site-directed mutations constitute one important source of information to obtain these mixed-resolution structural models. A very common problem with this strategy, however, is the difficulty to simultaneously integrate all the information from multiple independent experiments involving different mutations or chemical labels to derive a unique structural model consistent with the data. To resolve this issue, a novel restrained molecular dynamics structural refinement method is developed to simultaneously incorporate multiple experimentally determined constraints (e.g., engineered metal bridges or spin-labels), each treated as an individual molecular fragment with all atomic details. The internal structure of each of the molecular fragments is treated realistically, while there is no interaction between different molecular fragments to avoid unphysical steric clashes. The information from all the molecular fragments is exploited simultaneously to constrain the backbone to refine a three-dimensional model of the conformational state of the protein. The method is illustrated by refining the structure of the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) of the Kv1.2 potassium channel in the resting state and by exploring the distance histograms between spin-labels attached to T4 lysozyme. The resulting VSD structures are in good agreement with the consensus model of the resting state VSD and the spin-spin distance histograms from ESR/DEER experiments on T4 lysozyme are accurately reproduced.	2266.0
figshare	Replica-Based Protein Structure Sampling Methods II: Advanced Hybrid Solvent TIGER2hs	In many cases, native states of proteins may be predicted with sufficient accuracy by molecular dynamics simulations (MDSs) with modern force fields. Enhanced sampling methods based on MDS are applied for exploring the phase space of a protein sequence and to overcome barriers on rough conformational energy landscapes. The minimum free energy state is obtained with sampling algorithms providing sufficient convergence and accuracy. A reliable but computationally very expensive method is replica exchange molecular dynamics, with many modifications to this approach presented in the past. Recently, we demonstrated how our temperature intervals with global exchange of replicas hybrid (TIGER2h) solvent sampling algorithm made a good compromise between efficiency and accuracy. There, all states are sampled under full explicit solvent conditions with a freely chosen number of replicas, whereas an implicit solvent is used during the swap decisions. This hybrid method yielded a much better approximation to the agreement with calculations in an explicit solvent than fully implicit solvent simulations. Here, we present an extension of TIGER2h and add a few layers of explicit water molecules around the peptide for the energy calculations, whereas the dynamics in fully explicit water is maintained. We claim that these water layers better reproduce steric effects, the polarization of the solvent, and the resulting reaction field energy than typical implicit solvent models. By investigating the protein–solvent interactions across comprehensive thermodynamic state ensembles, we found a strong conformational dependence of this reaction field energy. All simulations were performed with nanoscale molecular dynamics on two peptides, the α-helical peptide (AAQAA)3 and the β-hairpin peptide HP7. A production-ready TIGER2hs implementation is supplied, approaching the accuracy of full explicit solvent sampling at a fraction of computational resources.	2045.0
figshare	Computational Calorimetry: High-Precision Calculation of Host–Guest Binding Thermodynamics	We present a strategy for carrying out high-precision calculations of binding free energy and binding enthalpy values from molecular dynamics simulations with explicit solvent. The approach is used to calculate the thermodynamic profiles for binding of nine small molecule guests to either the cucurbit[7]­uril (CB7) or β-cyclodextrin (βCD) host. For these systems, calculations using commodity hardware can yield binding free energy and binding enthalpy values with a precision of ∼0.5 kcal/mol (95% CI) in a matter of days. Crucially, the self-consistency of the approach is established by calculating the binding enthalpy directly, via end point potential energy calculations, and indirectly, via the temperature dependence of the binding free energy, i.e., by the van’t Hoff equation. Excellent agreement between the direct and van’t Hoff methods is demonstrated for both host–guest systems and an ion-pair model system for which particularly well-converged results are attainable. Additionally, we find that hydrogen mass repartitioning allows marked acceleration of the calculations with no discernible cost in precision or accuracy. Finally, we provide guidance for accurately assessing numerical uncertainty of the results in settings where complex correlations in the time series can pose challenges to statistical analysis. The routine nature and high precision of these binding calculations opens the possibility of including measured binding thermodynamics as target data in force field optimization so that simulations may be used to reliably interpret experimental data and guide molecular design.	1701.0
figshare	On Use of the Amber Potential with the Langevin Dipole Method	Inclusion of solvent effects in biomolecular simulations is most ideally done using explicit methods, as they are able to capture the heterogeneous environment typical of biomolecules and systems involving them (e.g., proteins at solid interfaces). Common explicit methods based on molecular solvent models (e.g., TIP and SPC models) and molecular dynamic or Monte Carlo simulation are computationally expensive and are, therefore, not well-suited to situations where many simulations are required (e.g., in the ab initio structure prediction or design contexts). In such cases, more coarse-grained explicit approaches such as the Langevin dipole (LD) method of Warshel and co-workers are more appropriate. The recent incarnations of the LD method appear to produce good solvation free energy estimates. These incarnations use charges and solute structures obtained from high-level quantum mechanics simulations. As such an approach is clearly not possible for larger solutes or when many structures are to be considered, an alternative must be sought. One possibility is to use structures and charges derived from an existing analytical potential modelwe report on such a coupling here with the Amber potential model. The accuracy and computational performance of this hybrid approach, which we term LD−Amber to distinguish it from previous incarnations of the LD method, was assessed by comparing results obtained from the approach with those from experiment and other theoretical methods for the solvation of 18 amino acid analogues and the alanine dipeptide. This comparison shows that the LD−Amber approach can yield results in line with experiment both qualitatively and quantitatively and is as accurate as other explicit methods while being computationally much cheaper.	1840.0
figshare	Discovery and Computational Studies of Potent Covalent Kinase Inhibitors with α‑Substituent Electrophiles Targeting Cysteine	Both reversible noncovalent inhibitors and irreversible covalent inhibitors targeting tyrosine kinases have their disadvantages. The reversible covalent inhibitors with electrophilic group cyanoacrylamide as warheads reacting with cysteine residues could solve the dilemmas. However, there are still several unresolved issues regarding the electrophilic groups. In this manuscript, a series of EGFR inhibitors with double electron-withdrawing substituents introduced into the Cα position on the olefin bond were designed and synthesized. The binding structures and characteristics of inhibitors with the kinase in both the first noncovalent binding phase and the second covalent binding step were explored and combined with molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Then, the reverse β-elimination reactions of the thiol-Michael adducts were investigated by applying density functional theory calculations. In addition, the effects of different electrophilic substituents of Cα on the binding between the inhibitors and kinase were elucidated. The results suggested that the electrophilicity and size of the electron-withdrawing groups play an important role in the specific interactions during the reaction. The compounds with the electron-withdrawing groups that had medium electrostatic and steric complementarity to the kinase active site could cooperatively stabilize the complexes and showed relatively good potent activities in the kinase assay experiment. The mechanical and structural information in this study could enhance our understanding of the functioning of the electron-withdrawing groups in the covalent inhibitors. The results might help to design efficient cysteine targeting inhibitors in the future.	1857.0
figshare	Scaffold Hopping Transformations Using Auxiliary Restraints for Calculating Accurate Relative Binding Free Energies	In silico screening of drug–target interactions is a key part of the drug discovery process. Changes in the drug scaffold via contraction or expansion of rings, the breaking of rings, and the introduction of cyclic structures from acyclic structures are commonly applied by medicinal chemists to improve binding affinity and enhance favorable properties of candidate compounds. These processes, commonly referred to as scaffold hopping, are challenging to model computationally. Although relative binding free energy (RBFE) calculations have shown success in predicting binding affinity changes caused by perturbing R-groups attached to a common scaffold, applications of RBFE calculations to modeling scaffold hopping are relatively limited. Scaffold hopping inevitably involves breaking and forming bond interactions of quadratic functional forms, which is highly challenging. A novel method for handling ring opening/closure/contraction/expansion and linker contraction/expansion is presented here. To the best of our knowledge, RBFE calculations on linker contraction/expansion have not been previously reported. The method uses auxiliary restraints to hold the atoms at the ends of a bond in place during the breaking and forming of the bonds. The broad applicability of the method was demonstrated by examining perturbations involving small-molecule macrocycles and mutations of proline in proteins. High accuracy was obtained using the method for most of the perturbations studied. The rigor of the method was isolated from the force field by validating the method using relative and absolute hydration free energy calculations compared to standard simulation results. Unlike other methods that rely on λ-dependent functional forms for bond interactions, the method presented here can be employed using modern molecular dynamics software without modification of codes or force field functions.	2015.0

The accuracy of the simulation, however, is highly determined by the molecular mechanics (MM) force field (FF), a set of functions with adjustable parameters to compute the potential energies from atomic positions. However, the overall quality of the FF, such as our previously published ff99SB and ff14SB, can be limited by assumptions that were made years ago. In the updated model presented here (ff19SB), we have significantly improved the backbone profiles for all 20 amino acids. We fit coupled φ/ψ parameters using 2D φ/ψ conformational scans for multiple amino acids, using as reference data the entire 2D quantum mechanics (QM) energy surface. We address the polarization inconsistency during dihedral parameter fitting by using both QM and MM in aqueous solution. Finally, we examine possible dependency of the backbone fitting on side chain rotamer. To extensively validate ff19SB parameters, and to compare to results using other Amber models, we have performed a total of ∼5 ms MD simulations in explicit solvent. Our results show that after amino-acid-specific training against QM data with solvent polarization, ff19SB not only reproduces the differences in amino-acid-specific Protein Data Bank (PDB) Ramachandran maps better but also shows significantly improved capability to differentiate amino-acid-dependent properties such as helical propensities. We also conclude that an inherent underestimation of helicity is present in ff14SB, which is (inexactly) compensated for by an increase in helical content driven by the TIP3P bias toward overly compact structures. In summary, ff19SB, when combined with a more accurate water model such as OPC, should have better predictive power for modeling sequence-specific behavior, protein mutations, and also rational protein design. Of the explicit water models tested here, we recommend use of OPC with ff19SB.	2113.0
figshare	How the Choice of Force-Field Affects the Stability and Self-Assembly Process of Supramolecular CTA Fibers	In recent years, computational methods have become an essential element of studies focusing on the self-assembly process. Although they provide unique insights, they face challenges, from which two are the most often mentioned in the literature: the temporal and spatial scale of the self-assembly. A less often mentioned issue, but not less important, is the choice of the force-field. The repetitive nature of the supramolecular structure results in many similar interactions. Consequently, even a small deviation in these interactions can lead to significant energy differences in the whole structure. However, studies comparing different force-fields for self-assembling systems are scarce. In this article, we compare molecular dynamics simulations for trifold hydrogen-bonded fibers performed with different force-fields, namely GROMOS, CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF), CHARMM Drude, General Amber Force-Field (GAFF), Martini, and polarized Martini. Briefly, we tested the force-fields by simulating: (i) spontaneous self-assembly (none form a fiber within 500 ns), (ii) stability of the fiber (observed for CHARMM Drude, GAFF, MartiniP), (iii) dimerization (observed for GROMOS, GAFF, and MartiniP), and (iv) oligomerization (observed for CHARMM Drude and MartiniP). This system shows that knowledge of the force-field behavior regarding interactions in oligomer and larger self-assembled structures is crucial for designing efficient simulation protocols for self-assembling systems.	1601.0
figshare	Structural Characterization of Alkylsilane and Fluoroalkylsilane Self-Assembled Monolayers on SiO2 by Molecular Dynamics Simulations	We present molecular dynamics simulations of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) chemisorbed on an atomically flat amorphous silicon dioxide substrate. We model two prototypical SAM-forming alkylsilanes, octadecyl­trichlorosilane (OTS) and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluoro­decyl­trichlorosilane (FDTS), that find widespread use in organic electronic applications. Crucially, our model does not rely on an explicit bonding between the alkylsilane and the substrate, thus allowing for the spontaneous organization of molecules into regular structures, which we studied as a function of coverage. By comparing the calculated tilt angle, film thickness, and lattice parameters with experiments, we conclude that the simulated morphologies are quantitatively consistent with the experimental evidence, demonstrating the accuracy of the simulation methodology. We take advantage of the atomistic resolution of the calculations for carrying out a detailed one-to-one comparison between the structure and the electronic properties of the two SAMs. In particular, we find that OTS molecules show a coverage-dependent tilt, while FDTS molecules are always vertically oriented, regardless of the coverage. More importantly for organic electronic applications, we observe that OTS SAMs do not alter the electrostatic potential of silica, while FDTS SAMs induce a negative voltage shift which increases with coverage and saturates at about −2 V.	1550.0
figshare	Strategies for Enhancing the Dielectric Constant of Organic Materials	High dielectric constant organic semiconductors, often obtained by the use of ethylene glycol (EG) side chains, have gained attention in recent years in the efforts of improving the device performance for various applications. Dielectric constant enhancements due to EGs have been demonstrated extensively, but various effects, such as the choice of the particular molecule and the frequency and temperature regime, that determine the extent of this enhancement require further understanding. In this work, we study these effects by means of polarizable molecular dynamics simulations on a carefully selected set of fullerene derivatives with EG side chains. The selection allows studying the dielectric response in terms of both the number and length of EG chains and also the choice of the group connecting the fullerene to the EG chain. The computed time- and frequency-dependent dielectric responses reveal that the experimentally observed rise of the dielectric constant within the kilo/megahertz regime for some molecules is likely due to the highly stretched dielectric response of the EGs: the initial sharp increase over the first few nanoseconds is followed by a smaller but persistent increase in the range of microseconds. Additionally, our computational protocol allows the separation of different factors that contribute to the overall dielectric constant, providing insights to make several molecular design guides for future organic materials in order to enhance their dielectric constant further.	1582.0
figshare	Path to Actinorhodin: Regio- and Stereoselective Ketone Reduction by a Type II Polyketide Ketoreductase Revealed in Atomistic Detail	In type II polyketide synthases (PKSs), which typically biosynthesize several antibiotic and antitumor compounds, the substrate is a growing polyketide chain, shuttled between individual PKS enzymes, while covalently tethered to an acyl carrier protein (ACP): this requires the ACP interacting with a series of different enzymes in succession. During biosynthesis of the antibiotic actinorhodin, produced by Streptomyces coelicolor, one such key binding event is between an ACP carrying a 16-carbon octaketide chain (actACP) and a ketoreductase (actKR). Once the octaketide is bound inside actKR, it is likely cyclized between C7 and C12 and regioselective reduction of the ketone at C9 occurs: how these elegant chemical and conformational changes are controlled is not yet known. Here, we perform protein–protein docking, protein NMR, and extensive molecular dynamics simulations to reveal a probable mode of association between actACP and actKR; we obtain and analyze a detailed model of the C7–C12-cyclized octaketide within the actKR active site; and we confirm this model through multiscale (QM/MM) reaction simulations of the key ketoreduction step. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the most thermodynamically stable cyclized octaketide isomer (7R,12R) also gives rise to the most reaction competent conformations for ketoreduction. Subsequent reaction simulations show that ketoreduction is stereoselective as well as regioselective, resulting in an S-alcohol. Our simulations further indicate several conserved residues that may be involved in selectivity of C7-12 cyclization and C9 ketoreduction. Detailed insights obtained on ACP-based substrate presentation in type II PKSs can help design ACP-ketoreductase systems with altered regio- or stereoselectivity.	1910.0
figshare	Coarse-Grained Parameterization of Nucleotide Cofactors and Metabolites: Protonation Constants, Partition Coefficients, and Model Topologies	Nucleotides are structural units relevant not only in nucleic acids but also as substrates or cofactors in key biochemical reactions. The size- and timescales of such nucleotide–protein interactions fall well within the scope of coarse-grained molecular dynamics, which holds promise of important mechanistic insight. However, the lack of specific parameters has prevented accurate coarse-grained simulations of protein interactions with most nucleotide compounds. In this work, we comprehensively develop coarse-grained parameters for key metabolites/cofactors (FAD, FMN, riboflavin, NAD, NADP, ATP, ADP, AMP, and thiamine pyrophosphate) in different oxidation and protonation states as well as for smaller molecules derived from them (among others, nicotinamide, adenosine, adenine, ribose, thiamine, and lumiflavin), summing up a total of 79 different molecules. In line with the Martini parameterization methodology, parameters were tuned to reproduce octanol–water partition coefficients. Given the lack of existing data, we set out to experimentally determine these partition coefficients, developing two methodological approaches, based on 31P-NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy, specifically tailored to the strong hydrophilicity of most of the parameterized compounds. To distinguish the partition of each relevant protonation species, we further potentiometrically characterized the protonation constants of key molecules. This work successfully builds a comprehensive and relevant set of computational models that will boost the biochemical application of coarse-grained simulations. It does so based on the measurement of partition and acid–base physicochemical data that, in turn, covers important gaps in nucleotide characterization.	1886.0
figshare	Assessing the Accuracy and Performance of Implicit Solvent Models for Drug Molecules: Conformational Ensemble Approaches	The accuracy and performance of implicit solvent methods for solvation free energy calculations were assessed on a set of 20 neutral drug molecules. Molecular dynamics (MD) provided ensembles of conformations in water and water-saturated octanol. The solvation free energies were calculated by popular implicit solvent models based on quantum mechanical (QM) electronic densities (COSMO-RS, MST, SMD) as well as on molecular mechanical (MM) point-charge models (GB, PB). The performance of the implicit models was tested by a comparison with experimental water–octanol transfer free energies (ΔGow) by using single- and multiconformation approaches. MD simulations revealed difficulties in a priori estimation of the flexibility features of the solutes from simple structural descriptors, such as the number of rotatable bonds. An increasing accuracy of the calculated ΔGow was observed in the following order: GB1 ∼ PB < GB7 ≪ MST < SMD ∼ COSMO-RS with a clear distinction identified between MM- and QM-based models, although for the set excluding three largest molecules, the differences among COSMO-RS, MST, and SMD were negligible. It was shown that the single-conformation approach applied to crystal geometries provides a rather accurate estimate of ΔGow for rigid molecules yet fails completely for the flexible ones. The multiconformation approaches improved the performance, but only when the deformation contribution was ignored. It was revealed that for large-scale calculations on small molecules a recent GB model, GB7, provided a reasonable accuracy/speed ratio. In conclusion, the study contributes to the understanding of solvation free energy calculations for physical and medicinal chemistry applications.	1843.0
figshare	MLCV: Bridging Machine-Learning-Based Dimensionality Reduction and Free-Energy Calculation	Importance-sampling algorithms leaning on the definition of a model reaction coordinate (RC) are widely employed to probe processes relevant to chemistry and biology alike, spanning time scales not amenable to common, brute-force molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In practice, the model RC often consists of a handful of collective variables (CVs) chosen on the basis of chemical intuition. However, constructing manually a low-dimensional RC model to describe an intricate geometrical transformation for the purpose of free-energy calculations and analyses remains a daunting challenge due to the inherent complexity of the conformational transitions at play. To solve this issue, remarkable progress has been made in employing machine-learning techniques, such as autoencoders, to extract the low-dimensional RC model from a large set of CVs. Implementation of the differentiable, nonlinear machine-learned CVs in common MD engines to perform free-energy calculations is, however, particularly cumbersome. To address this issue, we present here a user-friendly tool (called MLCV) that facilitates the use of machine-learned CVs in importance-sampling simulations through the popular Colvars module. Our approach is critically probed with three case examples consisting of small peptides, showcasing that through hard-coded neural network in Colvars, deep-learning and enhanced-sampling can be effectively bridged with MD simulations. The MLCV code is versatile, applicable to all the CVs available in Colvars, and can be connected to any kind of dense neural networks. We believe that MLCV provides an effective, powerful, and user-friendly platform accessible to experts and nonexperts alike for machine-learning (ML)-guided CV discovery and enhanced-sampling simulations to unveil the molecular mechanisms underlying complex biochemical processes.	1944.0
figshare	Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Depth Distribution of Spin-Labeled Phospholipids within Lipid Bilayer	Spin-labeled lipids are commonly used as fluorescence quenchers in studies of membrane penetration of dye-labeled proteins and peptides using depth-dependent quenching. Accurate calculations of depth of the fluorophore rely on the use of several spin labels placed in the membrane at various positions. The depth of the quenchers (spin probes) has to be determined independently; however, experimental determination of transverse distributions of spin probe depths is difficult. In this Article, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the membrane behavior and depth distributions of spin-labeled phospholipids in a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) bilayer. To probe different depths within the bilayer, a series containing five Doxyl-labeled lipids (n-Doxyl PC) has been studied, in which a spin moiety was covalently attached to nth carbon atoms (where n = 5, 7, 10, 12, and 14) of the sn-2 stearoyl chain of the host phospholipid. Our results demonstrate that the chain-attached spin labels are broadly distributed across the model membrane and their environment is characterized by a high degree of mobility and structural heterogeneity. Despite the high thermal disorder, the depth distributions of the Doxyl labels were found to correlate well with their attachment positions, indicating that the distribution of the spin label within the model membrane is dictated by the depth of the nth lipid carbon atom and not by intrinsic properties of the label. In contrast, a much broader and heterogeneous distribution was observed for a headgroup-attached Tempo spin label of Tempo-PC lipids. MD simulations reveal that, due to the hydrophobic nature, a Tempo moiety favors partitioning from the headgroup region deeper into the membrane. Depending on the concentration of Tempo-PC lipids, the probable depth of the Tempo moiety could span a range from 14.4 to 18.2 Å from the membrane center. Comparison of the MD-estimated immersion depths of Tempo and n-Doxyl labels with their suggested experimental depth positions allows us to review critically the possible sources of error in depth-dependent fluorescence quenching studies.	2271.0
figshare	Exploring Methamphetamine Nonenantioselectively Targeting Toll-like Receptor 4/Myeloid Differentiation Protein 2 by in Silico Simulations and Wet-Lab Techniques	Methamphetamine (METH) is one of the highly addictive nonopioid psychostimulants, acting as a xenobiotic-associated molecular pattern (XAMP) to target TLR4 and activate microglia. However, the molecule recognition of METH by innate immune receptor TLR4/MD-2 is not well-understood. METH exists in two enantiomeric forms, and it is unclear whether the TLR4 innate immune recognition with METH is stereoselective. Herein, molecular dynamics (MDs) simulations were performed to dissect the recognition of (+)-METH and (−)-METH by TLR4/MD-2 at the atomic level. Amphetamine (AMPH), which is an analogue of METH, was also investigated for comparison. Computational simulations indicate that METH binds into the interaction interface between MD-2 as well as TLR4* that is from the adjacent copy of TLR4-MD-2, therefore stabilizing the active heterotetramer (TLR4/MD-2)2 complex. The calculated binding free energies and potential of mean force (PMF) values show that (−)-METH and (+)-METH have similar TLR4/MD-2 binding affinity. Further dynamics analyses of bindings with TLR4/MD-2 indicate that (−)-METH and (+)-METH behave similarly. Unlike the stereoselective neuron-stimulating activities of METH, no enantioselectivity was observed for METH interacting with TLR4/MD-2 complex as well as activating TLR4 signaling. Compared to METH, AMPH showed much weaker interactions with TLR4/MD-2, indicating that the substituted methyl group is critical in the molecular recognition of METH by TLR4/MD-2. In all, this study provides molecular insight into the innate immune recognition of METH, which demonstrates that METH could be nonenantioselectively sensed by TLR4/MD-2.	1823.0
figshare	A Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Approach to the Study of the Intrinsically Disordered Protein α‑Synuclein	Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are not well described by a single 3D conformation but by an ensemble of them, which makes their structural characterization especially challenging, both experimentally and computationally. Most all-atom force fields are designed for folded proteins and give too compact IDP conformations. α-Synuclein is a well-known IDP because of its relation to Parkinson’s disease (PD). To understand its role in this disease at the molecular level, an efficient methodology is needed for the generation of conformational ensembles that are consistent with its known properties (in particular, with its dimensions) and that is readily extensible to post-translationally modified forms of the protein, commonly found in PD patients. Herein, we have contributed to this goal by performing explicit-solvent, microsecond-long Replica Exchange with Solute Scaling (REST2) simulations of α-synuclein with the coarse-grained force field SIRAH, finding that a 30% increase in the default strength of protein–water interactions yields a much better reproduction of its radius of gyration. Other known properties of α-synuclein, such as chemical shifts, secondary structure content, and long-range contacts, are also reproduced. Furthermore, we have simulated a glycated form of α-synuclein to suggest the extensibility of the method to its post-translationally modified forms. The computationally efficient REST2 methodology in combination with coarse-grained representations will facilitate the simulations of this relevant IDP and its modified forms, enabling a better understanding of their roles in disease and potentially leading to efficient therapies.	1787.0

figshare	Halogen Bonding: An Underestimated Player in Membrane–Ligand Interactions	Halogen bonds (XBs) are noncovalent interactions where halogen atoms act as electrophilic species interacting with Lewis bases. These interactions are relevant in biochemical systems being increasingly explored in drug discovery, mainly to modulate protein–ligand interactions, but are also found in engineered protein or nucleic acid systems. In this work, we report direct evidence for the existence of XBs in the context of biological membrane systems, thus expanding the scope of application of these interactions. Indeed, our molecular dynamics simulations show the presence of favorable interactions between halobenzene derivatives and both phosphate or ester oxygen acceptors from a model phospholipid bilayer, thus supporting the existence of XB-mediated phospholipid–halogen recognition phenomena influencing the membrane insertion profile of the ligands and their orientational preferences. This represents a relevant interaction, previously overlooked, eventually determining the pharmacological or toxicological activity of halogenated compounds and hence with potential implications in drug discovery and development, a place where such species account for a significant part of the chemical space. We also provide insights into a potential role for XBs in the water-to-membrane insertion of halogenated ligands as XBs are systematically observed during this process. Therefore, our data strongly suggest that, as the ubiquitous hydrogen bond, XBs should be accounted for in the development of membrane partition models.	1606.0
figshare	Impact of Remdesivir Incorporation along the Primer Strand on SARS-CoV‑2 RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase	Remdesivir was the first antiviral drug that received emergency use authorization from the United States Food and Drug Administration and is now formally approved to treat COVID-19. Remdesivir is a nucleotide analogue that targets the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The solution of multiple RdRp structures has been one of the main axes of research in the race against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Several hypotheses of the mechanism of inhibition of RdRp by remdesivir have been proposed, although open questions remain. This work uses molecular dynamics simulations to explore the impact of remdesivir and two analogues as incoming nucleotides and of up to four incorporations of remdesivir along the primer strand on RdRp. The simulation results suggest that the overall structure and the dynamical behavior of RdRp are destabilized by remdesivir and the two analogues in the incoming position. The incorporation of remdesivir along the primer strand impacts specific non-bonded interactions between the nascent RNA and the polymerase subunit, as well as the overall dynamical networks on RdRp. The strongest impact on the structure and dynamics are observed after three incorporations, when remdesivir is located at position −A3, in agreement with previously reported experimental and computational results. Our results provide atomic-level details of the role played by remdesivir on the disruption of RNA synthesis by RdRp and the main drivers of these disruptions.	1610.0
figshare	Cholesteryl Hemisuccinate Is Not a Good Replacement for Cholesterol in Lipid Nanodiscs	Nanodiscs are suitable tools for studies of membrane proteins (MPs) due to their ability to mimic native biological membranes, and several MP structures are solved in nanodiscs. Among the various cell membrane components, cholesterol (CHL) is known to regulate protein function and its concentration can reach up to 50 mol %. However, studies comprising cholesterol are challenging due to its hydrophobic nature, hence, nanodiscs with only a low cholesterol concentration have been studied. To overcome the problem, cholesterol analogs with high solubility in polar solutions are often used, and one of them is cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS). Nevertheless, in molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, this is not an obstacle. In this study, we performed MD simulations of nanodiscs containing neutral phosphatidylcholine (POPC) lipids, negatively charged phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) lipids, CHL, or negatively charged cholesterol analog, CHS. Our simulations show that CHS increases the order of lipids in nanodiscs; the effect is, however, weaker than CHL and even smaller in nanodiscs. Furthermore, CHS gathered around scaffold proteins while cholesterol was uniformly distributed in the nanodiscs. Thus, nanodiscs with CHS are heterogeneous and not equivalent to nanodiscs with CHL. Finally, we also observed the increased concentration of POPG near the scaffold proteins, driven by electrostatic interactions. The MD results are experimentally validated using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. These results show that nanodiscs are, in fact, complex structures not easily comparable with planar lipid bilayers.	1708.0
figshare	Modeling of Arylamide Helix Mimetics in the p53 Peptide Binding Site of hDM2 Suggests Parallel and Anti-Parallel Conformations Are Both Stable	The design of novel α-helix mimetic inhibitors of protein-protein interactions is of interest to pharmaceuticals and chemical genetics researchers as these inhibitors provide a chemical scaffold presenting side chains in the same geometry as an α-helix. This conformational arrangement allows the design of high affinity inhibitors mimicking known peptide sequences binding specific protein substrates. We show that GAFF and AutoDock potentials do not properly capture the conformational preferences of α-helix mimetics based on arylamide oligomers and identify alternate parameters matching solution NMR data and suitable for molecular dynamics simulation of arylamide compounds. Results from both docking and molecular dynamics simulations are consistent with the arylamides binding in the p53 peptide binding pocket. Simulations of arylamides in the p53 binding pocket of hDM2 are consistent with binding, exhibiting similar structural dynamics in the pocket as simulations of known hDM2 binders Nutlin-2 and a benzodiazepinedione compound. Arylamide conformations converge towards the same region of the binding pocket on the 20 ns time scale, and most, though not all dihedrals in the binding pocket are well sampled on this timescale. We show that there are two putative classes of binding modes for arylamide compounds supported equally by the modeling evidence. In the first, the arylamide compound lies parallel to the observed p53 helix. In the second class, not previously identified or proposed, the arylamide compound lies anti-parallel to the p53 helix. 	1710.0

The triplet Sc2UC@Ih(31924)-C80 and quartet Sc2UN@Ih(31924)-C80, named after the spiral number (31924), are found to be thermodynamically stable and satisfy aromaticity rules. Furthermore, the restricted movements of the Sc2UX (X = C, N) cluster in Ih(31924)-C80 have been demonstrated via ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The six-electron transfer from the inner cluster to the cage results in the electronic structures (Sc2UX)6+@C806– (X = C, N), which were also confirmed by natural bond orbital analysis. On the basis of the frontier molecular orbitals, the oxidation states of uranium in Sc2UC@C80 and Sc2UN@C80 are +IV and +III, respectively, with residual electrons in 5f orbitals of U. The chemical bond between U and C (N) of the inner cluster is characterized as a double bond (single bond) by an analysis of the Mayer bond orders. There are covalent interactions between the inner cluster and outer cage, which is clarified by the quantum theory of atoms in molecules. IR spectra of the optimal isomers have also been simulated, which show the clear difference between Sc2UX@C80 (X = C, N). These findings, together with simulated results, are expected to supply useful information in future experiments of mixed-metal uranium-based endohedral clusterfullerenes.	1689.0
figshare	Structural Correspondence of Solution, Liquid Crystal, and Crystalline Phases of the Chromonic Mesogen Sunset Yellow	The azo dye, sunset yellow, is a prototypical, chromonic liquid crystal in which assembly in aqueous solution at high volume fraction leads to lyotropic mesophases with a “package of properties distinct in almost every aspect” (Lydon, J. Curr. Opin. Colloid Interface Sci. 2004, 8, 480). In particular, the isotropic to nematic transition in such phases, the consequence of stacking of dye molecules in chains, is difficult to bring into correspondence with athermal theories for rigid rods as well as modifications that consider chain interactions with one another. Chromonic mesogens, small molecules that stack to form lyotropic liquid crystals, prompt structural questions that have yet to be answered; a full understanding of structure should inform colligative properties. Herein, the single crystal structure of a guanidinium salt of the sunset yellow dianion, a known chromonic mesogen, is reported. The compound crystallizes as a dihydrate, tetrahydrofuran solvate in the orthorhombic space group Pnna, with a = 6.8426(5) Å, b = 20.048(1) Å, c = 21.466(2) Å. The sunset yellow molecules, point group approximately Cs, are disordered about a crystallographic diad axis. The structure is informative because pairwise interactions in the disordered crystal structure show a remarkable correspondence with the stereochemistry of sunset yellow molecules in solution and in the liquid crystal phase. The solution structure is here simulated by the combination of molecular dynamics, metadynamics, and quantum chemical computations. The comparable disorder in the fluid and solid states suggests the possibility that stacked aggregates adhere to growing crystals intact. Computations were used to evaluate proposals that stacking faults and branching points lower the X-ray correlation lengths while preserving extended structures. Evidence is found for stacking faults but not branches. The solution stereochemistry and stereodynamics has implications for the geometry of long rods, for which understanding is a prerequisite for reckoning properties of vexing chromonic mesophases.	2200.0
figshare	Spectroscopically Guided Simulations Reveal Distinct Strategies for Positioning Substrates to Achieve Selectivity in Nonheme Fe(II)/α-Ketoglutarate-Dependent Halogenases	Nonheme iron halogenases, such as SyrB2, WelO5, and BesD, halogenate unactivated carbon atoms of diverse substrates at ambient conditions with exquisite selectivity seldom matched by nonbiological catalysts. Using experimentally guided molecular dynamics (MD) simulations augmented with multiscale (i.e., quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics) simulations of substrate-bound complexes of BesD and WelO5, we investigate substrate/active-site dynamics that enable selective halogenation. Our simulations reveal that active-site configurational isomerization is necessary in WelO5 to attain a substrate/active-site geometry consistent with its observed chemo- and regioselectivity. Conversely, a slight reorientation of the substrate from its crystal structure position is sufficient to enable regioselective chlorination in BesD without the need to invoke active-site isomerization. We observe very different patterns of substrate–protein interactions for these two enzymes, and we relate the nature of these interactions to the distinct substrates. For BesD, we resolve the uncertainty around the mechanistic relevance of Asn219. Our simulations reveal that the optimum substrate/active-site geometry also outweighs the interactions between the metal-oxo and the protein environment in facilitating the required chemoselectivity in halogenases. Our work highlights how different substrate-dependent strategies are used to accomplish selectivity-promoting proximity in halogenases.	1648.0
figshare	Interfacial Structures in Ionic Liquid-Based Ternary Electrolytes for Lithium-Metal Batteries: A Molecular Dynamics Study	Lithium-metal batteries are promising candidates to fulfill the future performance requirements for energy storage applications. However, the tendency to form metallic dendrites and the undesirable side reactions between the electrolyte and the Li electrode lead to poor performance and safety issues in these batteries. Therefore, understanding the interfacial properties and the Li-metal surface/electrolyte interactions is crucial to resolve the remaining obstacles and make these devices feasible. Here, we report a computational study on the interface effects in ternary polymer electrolytes composed by poly­(ethylene oxide) (PEO), lithium salts, and different ionic liquids (ILs) confined between two Li-metal slabs. Atomistic simulations are used to characterize the local environment of the Li+ ions and the transport properties in the bulk and at the interface regions. Aggregation of ions at the metal surface is seen in all investigated systems; the structure and composition are directly correlated to the IL components. The strong interactions between the electrolyte species and the Li-metal atoms result in the structuring of the electrolyte at the interface region, in which comparatively small and flat ions result in a well-defined region with extensive Li+ populations and high self-diffusion coefficients. In contrast, large ions such as [P222mom]+ increase the PEO density in the bulk due to large steric effects at the interface. Therefore, the choice of specific ILs in ternary polymer electrolytes can tune the structure–dynamic properties at the Li-metal surface/electrolyte interface, controlling the SEI formation at the electrode surface, and thereby improve battery performance.	1829.0
figshare	Free Energy Calculation of Nanodiamond-Membrane AssociationThe Effect of Shape and Surface Functionalization	Nanodiamonds (NDs) are nanoscale diamond particles with broad applications in biosensing, drug delivery, and long-term tracking. Their interactions with a membrane dictate both the endocytosis process and subsequent intracellular fate of the nanoparticles. However, details of ND-membrane association and the energetics of this process remain largely unknown. In this work, we use all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to determine the free energy profile and molecular details of ND-membrane association, with a focus on the impact of shape and surface functionalization. Through altogether 6.5 μs umbrella sampling on six atomistic ND models of different shapes (spherical or pyramidal) and surface functionalization (5%, 35%, and 55%), we show that nanodiamonds associate favorably with the membrane, which is largely driven by ND–lipid interactions. During its membrane association, the shape of a nanodiamond plays a key role in determining the location of the free energy minimum, while its surface functionalization modulates the depth of the minimum. Of the six models studied here, all spherical NDs adhere to the bilayer surface, whereas pyramidal NDs, with the exception of the most functionalized P55, anchor inside the membrane. Shape also dominates the height of the free energy barrier: the sharp pyramidal NDs have much lower barriers against penetrating a POPC bilayer than spherical ones. Our all-atom ND models and their bilayer association strength determined here can be combined with future coarse-grained or continuum models to further explore ND–membrane interactions on larger length scales.	1732.0

While it is desirable to synthetically regulate OSC solid-state structure, there remains limited understanding of the rich and complex relationships among the molecular structure of the chromophores that comprise the OSC and the functional parameters of the processing environment (e.g., solvent, solution composition, and temperature), each of which will impact the final OSC structure and characteristics. Here, we are interested in exploring how chromophore chemistry and the processing environment impact the structures of oligomers comprised of electron-rich donor and electron-deficient acceptor moieties, as conformational variations among these groups can impact OSC formation. Specifically, we make use of quantum-chemical calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to systematically investigate how variations in molecular design and processing chemistry influence the structure, dynamics, and aggregation tendencies of donor–acceptor (D–A) oligomers in solution. The investigation reveals preferential rotational isomer populations as a function of the oligomer chemistry, solvent environment, and oligomer concentration. Notably, questions are brought forward concerning the current emphasis on the roles of noncovalent intramolecular interactions in the design of OSC building blocks. Overall, the results provide an in-depth molecular-scale foundation to allow for thermodynamic and kinetic control of OSC morphology development through chromophore design and solvent optimization.	1716.0
figshare	Fast Dynamic Docking Guided by Adaptive Electrostatic Bias: The MD-Binding Approach	Engineering chemical entities to modify how pharmaceutical targets function, as it is done in drug design, requires a good understanding of molecular recognition and binding. In this context, the limitations of statically describing bimolecular recognition, as done in docking/scoring, call for insightful and efficient dynamical investigations. On the experimental side, the characterization of dynamical binding processes is still in its infancy. Thus, computer simulations, particularly molecular dynamics (MD), are compelled to play a prominent role, allowing a deeper comprehension of the binding process and its causes and thus a more informed compound selection, making more significant the computational contribution to drug discovery (Carlson, H. A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002, 6, 447−452). Unfortunately, MD-based approaches cannot yet describe complex events without incurring prohibitive time and computational costs. Here, we present a new method for fully and dynamically simulating drug–target-complex formations, tested against a real world and pharmaceutically relevant benchmark set. The method, based on an adaptive, electrostatics-inspired bias, envisions a campaign of trivially parallel short MD simulations and a strategy to identify a near native binding pose from the sampled configurations. At an affordable computational cost, this method provided predictions of good accuracy also when the starting protein conformation was different from that of the crystal complex, a known hurdle for traditional molecular docking (Lexa, K. W.; Carlson, H. A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2012, 45, 301−343). Moreover, along the observed binding routes, it identified some key features also found by much more computationally expensive plain-MD simulations. Overall, this methodology represents significant progress in the description of binding phenomena.	1943.0

figshare	Accurately Predicting CO2 Reactive Absorption Properties in Aqueous Alkanolamine Solutions by Molecular Simulation Requiring No Solvent Experimental Data	We present a general atomistic simulation framework for efficient reactive equilibrium calculations in dilute solutions, and its application to CO2 reactive absorption in aqueous alkanolamine solutions. No experimental data of any kind are required for the solvents, and no empirical adjustments are required for its implementation. This hybrid methodology calculates reaction equilibrium constants by combining high-level quantum chemical calculations of ideal-gas standard reaction Gibbs energies (ΔG0) with conventional solvation free energy calculations obtained from classical force field methodology. For these quantities we use explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations with the General AMBER Force Field (GAFF). The resulting equilibrium constants are then coupled with a macroscopic Henry Law based ideal solution model to calculate the solution speciation and the CO2 partial pressure, PCO2. We show results for seven primary amines: monoethanolamine (MEA), 2-amino-2-methylpropanol (AMP), 1-amino-2-propanol (1-AP), 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol (AMPD), 2-aminopropane-1,3-diol (SAPD), 2-(2-aminoethoxy)­ethanol or diglycolamine (2-AEE or DGA, respectively), and 2-amino-1-propanol (2-AP). Experimental speciation and PCO2 data for some of these are available, with which we validate our methodology. We predict new results for others in cases when such data are unavailable, and provide explanations for the experimental inability to detect carbamate solution species in relevant cases. Our results for the pK value of the carbamate reversion reaction are within the chemical accuracy limit of 218.546/T units (corresponding to 1 kcal·mol–1 in the corresponding free energy change) in comparison with experimental results when such data exist, which at 298.15 K corresponds to 0.73 pK units. The precision of our pK predictions is comparable to that which can be obtained from conventional experimental methodologies for these quantities. Our results suggest that the presented molecular simulation methodology may provide a robust and cost-efficient tool for solvent screening in the design of post-combustion CO2 capture processes.	2307.0
figshare	Atomistic Perspective on Biomolecular Adsorption on Functionalized Carbon Nanomaterials under Ambient Conditions	The use of carbon-based nanomaterials is tremendously increasing in various areas of technological, bioengineering, and biomedical applications. The functionality of carbon-based nanomaterials can be further broadened via chemical functionalization of carbon nanomaterial surfaces. On the other hand, concern is rising on possible adverse effects when nanomaterials are taken up by biological organisms. In order to contribute into understanding of interactions of carbon-based nanomaterials with biological matter, we have investigated adsorption of small biomolecules on nanomaterials using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics. The biomolecules included amino acid side chain analogues, fragments of lipids, and sugar monomers. The adsorption behavior on unstructured amorphous carbon, pristine graphene and its derivatives (such as few-layer graphene, graphene oxide, and reduced graphene oxide) as well as pristine carbon nanotubes, and those functionalized with OH–, COOH–, COO–, NH2–, and NH3+ groups was investigated with respect to surface concentration. An adsorption profile, that is, the free energy as a function of distance from the nanomaterial surfaces, was determined for each molecule and surface using the Metadynamics approach. The results were analyzed in terms of chemical specificity, surface charge, and surface concentration. It was shown that although morphology of the nanomaterial has a limited effect on the adsorption properties, functionalization of the surface by various molecular groups can drastically change the adsorption behavior that can be used in the design of nanosurfaces with highly selective adsorption properties and safe for human health and environment.	1813.0
figshare	Affinity Calculations of Cyclodextrin Host–Guest Complexes: Assessment of Strengths and Weaknesses of End-Point Free Energy Methods	The end-point methods like MM/PBSA or MM/GBSA estimate the free energy of a biomolecule by combining its molecular mechanics energy with solvation free energy and entropy terms. On the one hand, their performance largely depends on the particular system of interest, and despite numerous attempts to improve their reliability that have resulted in many variants, there is still no clear alternative to improve their accuracy. On the other hand, the relatively small cyclodextrin host–guest complexes, for which high-quality binding calorimetric data are usually available, are becoming reference models for testing the accuracy of free energy methods. In this work, we further assess the performance of various MM/PBSA-like approaches as applied to cyclodextrin complexes. To this end, we select a set of complexes between β-cyclodextrin and 57 small organic molecules that has been previously studied with the binding energy distribution analysis method in combination with an implicit solvent model (Wickstrom, L.; He, P.; Gallicchio, E.; Levy, R. M. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2013, 9, 3136−3150). For each complex, a conventional 1.0 μs molecular dynamics simulation in explicit solvent is performed. Then we employ semiempirical quantum chemical calculations, several variants of the MM-PB­(GB)­SA methods, entropy estimations, etc., to assess the reliability of the end-point affinity calculations. The best end-point protocol in this study, which combines DFTB3 energies with entropy corrections, yields estimations of the binding free energies that still have substantial errors (RMSE = 2.2 kcal/mol), but it exhibits a good prediction capacity in terms of ligand ranking (R2 = 0.66) that is close to or even better than that of rigorous free energy methodologies. Our results can be helpful to discriminate between the intrinsic limitations of the end-point methods and other sources of error, such as the underlying energy and continuum solvation methods.	2093.0
figshare	AMBER-DYES: Characterization of Charge Fluctuations and Force Field Parameterization of Fluorescent Dyes for Molecular Dynamics Simulations	Recent advances in single molecule fluorescence experiments and theory allow a direct comparison and improved interpretation of experiment and simulation. To this end, force fields for a larger number of dyes are required which are compatible with and can be integrated into existing biomolecular force fields. Here, we developed, characterized, and implemented AMBER-DYES, a modular fluorescent label force field, for a set of 22 fluorescent dyes and their linkers from the Alexa, Atto, and Cy families, which are in common use for single molecule spectroscopy experiments. The force field is compatible with the AMBER protein force fields and the GROMACS molecular dynamics simulation program. The high electronic polarizability of the delocalized π-electron orbitals, as found in many fluorescent dyes, poses a particular challenge to point charge based force fields such as AMBER. To quantify the charge fluctuations due to the electronic polarizability, we simulated the 22 dyes in explicit solvent and sampled the charge fluctuations using QM/MM simulations at the B3LYP/6-31G*//TIP3P level of theory. The analysis of the simulations enabled us to derive ensemble fitted RESP charges from the solvated charge distributions of multiple trajectories. We observed broad, single peaked charge distributions for the conjugated ring atoms with well-defined mean values. The charge fitting procedure was validated against published charges of the dyelike amino acid tryptophan, which showed good agreement with existing tryptophan parameters from the AMBER, CHARMM, and OPLS force field families. A principal component analysis of the charge fluctuations revealed that a small number of collective coordinates suffices to describe most of the in-plane dye polarizability. The AMBER-DYES force field allows the rapid preparation of all atom molecular dynamics simulations of fluorescent systems for state of the art multi microsecond trajectories.	2084.0
figshare	How the Layer Alignment in Two-Dimensional Nanoporous Covalent Organic Frameworks Impacts Its Electronic Properties	Two-dimensional nanoporous covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) have gathered significant interest due to their wide range of applications. Due to the lack of strong covalent interlayer interactions, their layers can be stacked in countless ways, each resulting in unique nanoscale characteristics impacting the structural, chemical, and electronic properties. To characterize and understand the layer stacking in 2D COFs and its effect on the structural and electronic properties, we carried out a detailed density functional theory investigation on four materials, CTF-1, COF-1, COF-5, and Pc-PBBA. This entailed an in-depth evaluation of the potential energy as a function of the interlayer distance and offset, the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern, and the electronic properties. From the potential energy surfaces, the typical slipped AA-stacking configuration was confirmed as optimal for each of the 2D COFs, with a slight offset from a perfect alignment of the layers. The statically calculated PXRD patterns based on these optimized stacking configurations showed discrepancies when compared to experimental data. Instead, when properly accounting for dynamic fluctuations by calculating the average diffraction pattern over the course of a molecular dynamics simulation, a better agreement with the experiment is obtained. Different stacking configurations also profoundly affected the electronic band structure of COFs as the interlayer π–π interactions are significantly impacted by the layer offset. Evidently, with decreasing layer offsets, the π–π interactions increase due to the layer alignment, leading to a decrease in the band gap and an increase in interlayer charge mobility. Our study highlights the need for accurate modeling of the stacking configuration in 2D COFs as a small-scale deviation in the adjacent layer position can significantly affect the structural and electronic properties.	2038.0
figshare	Scalable Constant pH Molecular Dynamics in GROMACS	Molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations are used routinely to compute atomistic trajectories of complex systems. Systems are simulated in various ensembles, depending on the experimental conditions one aims to mimic. While constant energy, temperature, volume, and pressure are rather straightforward to model, pH, which is an equally important parameter in experiments, is more difficult to account for in simulations. Although a constant pH algorithm based on the λ-dynamics approach by Brooks and co-workers [Kong, X.; Brooks III, C. L. J. Chem. Phys.1996, 105, 2414–2423] was implemented in a fork of the GROMACS molecular dynamics program, uptake has been rather limited, presumably due to the poor scaling of that code with respect to the number of titratable sites. To overcome this limitation, we implemented an alternative scheme for interpolating the Hamiltonians of the protonation states that makes the constant pH molecular dynamics simulations almost as fast as a normal MD simulation with GROMACS. In addition, we implemented a simpler scheme, called multisite representation, for modeling side chains with multiple titratable sites, such as imidazole rings. This scheme, which is based on constraining the sum of the λ-coordinates, not only reduces the complexity associated with parametrizing the intramolecular interactions between the sites but also is easily extendable to other molecules with multiple titratable sites. With the combination of a more efficient interpolation scheme and multisite representation of titratable groups, we anticipate a rapid uptake of constant pH molecular dynamics simulations within the GROMACS user community.	1718.0
figshare	Impact of H‑Bonds and Porphyrins on Asphaltene Aggregation As Revealed by Molecular Dynamics Simulations	The presence of metalloporphyrins alongside asphaltenes in heavy fractions of crude oil is a key issue in petroleum exploration and upgrading. These compounds are also expected to display interfacial activity in water/toluene mixtures, but the origin of this phenomenon remains uncertain. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate complex asphaltene mixtures constituted of 10 different molecules, under also multifaceted solvation conditions (toluene/n-heptane/water). We add nickel and vanadium (under the form of vanadyl) porphyrins with occasionally grafted polar lateral chains, in these mixtures. The aggregation behavior and interaction with water molecules (as a model to have insights from the interfacial activity of such molecules) are intimately linked to the type of porphyrin and to the molecular properties of the asphaltenes (mainly the presence of polar lateral chains). Vanadium porphyrins, even without polar lateral chains, can form H-bonds that might contribute to their presence within asphaltene nanoaggregates. Moreover, when polar lateral chains are present in asphaltene molecules, the systems display a supramolecular organization with several distinct interactions at the same time. The shapes of these systems do not totally agree with the traditional Yen–Mullins model. In the first part of this work, we finally propose that complex asphaltene systems in complex solvent mixtures seem to have a supramolecular behavior with non-negligent colloidal behavior as well. This should be indicative that Yen–Mullins and Gray’s models of asphaltene self-assembly are neither conflictual nor antagonistic. They are two facets of a scale- and molecular structure-dependent complex mechanism.	1841.0
figshare	Trajectory-Based Simulation of EPR Spectra: Models of Rotational Motion for Spin Labels on Proteins	Direct time-domain simulation of continuous-wave (CW) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories has become increasingly popular, especially for proteins labeled with nitroxide spin labels. Due to the time-consuming nature of simulating adequately long MD trajectories, two approximate methods have been developed to reduce the MD-trajectory length required for modeling EPR spectra: hindered Brownian diffusion (HBD) and hidden Markov models (HMMs). Here, we assess the accuracy of these two approximate methods relative to direct simulations from MD trajectories for three spin-labeled protein systems (a simple helical peptide, a soluble protein, and a membrane protein) and two nitroxide spin labels with differing mobilities (R1 and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl-4-amino-4-carboxylic acid (TOAC)). We find that the HMMs generally outperform HBD. Although R1 dynamics partially resembles hindered Brownian diffusion, HMMs accommodate the multiple dynamic time scales for the transitions between rotameric states of R1 that cannot be captured accurately by a HBD model. The MD trajectories of the TOAC-labeled proteins show that its dynamics closely resembles slow multisite exchange between twist-boat and chair ring puckering states. This motion is modeled well by HMM but not by HBD. All MD-trajectory data processing, stochastic trajectory simulations, and CW EPR spectral simulations are implemented in EasySpin, a free software package for MATLAB.	1607.0
figshare	Fluorescence Probing of Thiol-Functionalized Gold Nanoparticles: Is Alkylthiol Coating of a Nanoparticle as Hydrophobic as Expected?	Understanding the interaction of fluorescent dyes with monolayer-protected gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) is of fundamental importance in designing new fluorescent nanomaterials. Among a variety of molecular sensors and reporters, fluorescent probes based on a 3-hydroxychromone (3HC) skeleton appear to be very promising. They exhibit the phenomenon of dual band emission, resulting from excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), known to be highly sensitive to a nature of microenvironment surrounding a fluorophore. In this study, dodecanethiol-protected gold nanoparticles were synthesized, and, owing to the transmission electron micrograph imaging, their average diameter was found to be ∼1.4 nm. Fluorescence titrations of the 3HC ESIPT probes with AuNPs in toluene solutions demonstrate significant changes in the intensity ratio of their normal and tautomeric emission bands, suggesting that the probe molecules become noncovalently bound to a dodecanethiol layer of AuNPs. Despite expected fluorescence quenching induced by close proximity to the metal surface, no fluorescence lifetime decrease was observed, indicating that a bound-fluorophore is shielded from a nanoparticle core. Further spectral analysis revealed that the ratiometric fluorescence changes could be interpreted as a consequence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between a probe and residual ethanol molecules, trapped into the dodecanethiol shell of AuNPs during the synthesis. Evidences for residual traces of ethanol in the ligand shell of the nanoparticles were also observed in NMR spectra, suggesting that alkylthiol-coated gold nanoparticles may not be as hydrophobic as one could expect. To elucidate structural features of dodecanethiol-stabilized gold nanoparticles at the supramolecular level, a molecular dynamics (MD) model of AuNP was developed. The model was based on the all-atom CHARMM27 force field parameters and parametrized according to available experimental data of the synthesized AuNPs. Our MD simulations show that in bulk toluene the 3HC probe molecule becomes weakly bound to a dodecanethiol monolayer, so that a fluorophore favors residence in an outer shell of AuNP. In addition, MD simulations of transfer of AuNP from bulk ethanol to toluene demonstrate that a small population of ethanol molecules are able to penetrate deeply into the dodecanethiol layer and may indeed be trapped into the ligand shell of alkylthiol-functionalized gold nanoparticles. The results of our fluorescence experiments and molecular dynamics simulation suggest that 3-hydroxychromones can be used as a noncovalent fluorescent labeling agent for alkylthiol-stabilized noble metal nanoparticles.	2825.0
figshare	Specificity and Reactivity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Serine/Threonine Kinases PknG and PknB	Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of Tuberculosis, has 11 eukaryotic-like serine/threonine protein kinases, which play essential roles in cell growth, signal transduction, and pathogenesis. Protein kinase G (PknG) regulates the carbon and nitrogen metabolism by phosphorylation of the glycogen accumulation regulator (GarA) protein at Thr21. Protein kinase B (PknB) is involved in cell wall synthesis and cell shape, as well as phosphorylates GarA but at Thr22. While PknG seems to be constitutively activated and recognition of GarA requires phosphorylation in its unstructured tail, PknB activation is triggered by phosphorylation of its activation loop, which allows binding of the forkhead-associated domain of GarA. In the present work, we used molecular dynamics and quantum-mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations of the catalytically competent complex and kinase activity assays to understand PknG/PknB specificity and reactivity toward GarA. Two hydrophobic residues in GarA, Val24 and Phe25, seem essential for PknG binding and allow specificity for Thr21 phosphorylation. On the other hand, phosphorylated residues in PknB bind Arg26 in GarA and regulate its specificity for Thr22. We also provide a detailed analysis of the free energy profile for the phospho-transfer reaction and show why PknG has a constitutively active conformation not requiring priming phosphorylation in contrast to PknB. Our results provide new insights into these two key enzymes relevant for Mtb and the mechanisms of serine/threonine phosphorylation in bacteria.	1669.0
figshare	Understanding the Binding of a Bifunctional Amidoximate–Carboxylate Ligand with Uranyl in Seawater	Extracting uranium from seawater remains a formidable challenge because of its extremely low concentration of 3.3 ppb. State-of-the-art polymeric sorbents employ both amidoximate and carboxylate groups on the side chains to achieve optimal U uptake and selectivity, but little is known about the synergistic effect between the two functional groups in binding with uranyl. Herein, we simulated the binding of a model amidoximate–carboxylate bifunctional ligand with uranyl using a combination of theoretical methods. Gas-phase quantum-mechanical calculations showed a chelate binding of a η2 amidoximate and a monodentate carboxylate to uranyl. Ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in an explicit water solvation model confirmed the stability of the chelate mode. Classical MD and free-energy simulations in 0.5 M NaCl showed that the carboxylate group binds first to uranyl, leading to a loose intermediate state, and then, the amidoximate group binds, resulting in a more stable and tight chelate state. Binding of the second bifunctional ligand follows a similar process, and the two ligands prefer a trans configuration around the uranyl group. The simulated free energies indicate that the two bifunctional ligands bind with uranyl 55 kJ/mol stronger than the two ligands with only amidoximate groups. This work suggests an important synergy between amidoximate and carboxylate groups in binding uranyl.	1515.0
figshare	Unpicking the Cause of Stereoselectivity in Actinorhodin Ketoreductase Variants with Atomistic Simulations	Ketoreductase enzymes (KRs) with a high degree of regio- and stereoselectivity are useful biocatalysts for the production of small, specific chiral alcohols from achiral ketones. Actinorhodin KR (actKR), part of a type II polyketide synthase involved in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic actinorhodin, can also turn over small ketones. In vitro studies assessing stereocontrol in actKR have found that, in the “reverse” direction, the wild-type (WT) enzyme’s mild preference for S-α-tetralol is enhanced by certain mutations (e.g., P94L) and entirely reversed by others (e.g., V151L) in favor of R-α-tetralol. Here, we employ computationally cost-effective atomistic simulations to rationalize these trends in WT, P94L, and V151L actKR using trans-1-decalone (1) as the model substrate. Three potential factors (FI–FIII) are investigated: frequency of pro-R vs pro-S reactive poses (FI) is assessed with classical molecular dynamics (MD), binding affinity of pro-R vs pro-S orientations (FII) is compared using the binding free energy method MM/PBSA, and differences in reaction barriers toward trans-1-decalol (FIII) are assessed by hybrid semiempirical quantum/classical (QM/MM) MD simulations with umbrella sampling, benchmarked with density functional theory. No single factor is found to dominate stereocontrol: FI largely determines the selectivity of V151L actKR, whereas FIII is more dominant in the case of P94L. It is also found that formation of S-trans-1-decalol or R-trans-1-decalol mainly arises from the reduction of the trans-1-decalone enantiomers (4aS,8aR)-1 or (4aR,8aS)-1, respectively. Our work highlights the complexity of enzyme stereoselectivity as well as the usefulness of atomistic simulations to aid the design of stereoselective biocatalysts.	1878.0
figshare	All-Atom Simulations Reveal a Key Interaction Network in the HLA-E/NKG2A/CD94 Immune Complex Fine-Tuned by the Nonameric Peptide	Natural killer (NK) cells, an important part of the innate immune system, can clear a wide variety of pathological challenges, including tumor, senescent, and virally infected cells. They express various activating and inhibitory receptors on their surface, and the balance of interactions between them and specific ligands displayed on the surface of target cells is critical for NK cell cytolytic function and target cell protection. The CD94/NKG2A heterodimer is one of the inhibitory receptors that interacts with its trimeric ligand consisting of HLA-E, β2m, and a nonameric peptide. Here, multi-microsecond-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of eight immune complexes elucidate the subtleties of receptor (NKG2A/CD94)–ligand (HLA-E/β2m/peptide) molecular recognition that mediate the NK cell protection from a geometric and energetic perspective. We identify key differences in the interactions between the receptor and ligand complexes, which are via an entangled network of hydrogen bonds fine-tuned by the ligand-specific nonameric peptide. We further reveal that the receptor protein NKG2A regulates the NK cell activity, while its CD94 partner forms the majority of the energetically important interactions with the ligand. This knowledge rationalizes the atomistic details of the fundamental NK cell protection mechanism and may enable a variety of opportunities in rational-based drug discovery for diverse pathologies including viral infections and cancer and elimination of senescent cells associated with potential treatment of many age-related diseases.	1708.0
figshare	Molecular View on the Dissociation Pathways and Transactivation Regulation Mechanism of Nonsteroidal GR Ligands	As a major drug target for anti-inflammatory therapy, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates a wide range of physiological processes through transactivation (TA) or transrepression. GR TA is involved in many adverse effects of GR-targeting drugs, and therefore, the discovery of novel GR ligands with lower TA activity and longer residence time is quite urgent. Undoubtedly, understanding the ligand dissociation mechanisms and the structural basis of the TA regulation is crucial for the development of novel GR-targeting drugs. Here, we used random accelerated molecular dynamics (RAMD) and funnel metadynamics (FM) simulations to explore the dissociation mechanisms of 5 classic glucocorticoids and 6 nonsteroidal GR ligands. Multiple ligand dissociation pathways were discovered. The classic glucocorticoids exhibit a strong preference for Path I, and most nonsteroidal ligands tend to dissociate along mixed pathways. We also find that the distinct unbinding preferences for AZD2906 and AZD9567, two representative nonsteroidal ligands with similar scaffolds but different TA activities, are primarily determined by their different polar interactions with the surrounding residues. Notably, the binding of AZD9567 poses a substantial impact on the conformation of the GR homodimer interface, which provides a valuable clue to understand the mechanisms of the TA-related side effects induced by the adjustments of the homodimerization process. These findings are critical for the structure-based rational design of novel GR ligands with more potent anti-inflammatory potency and reduced side effects.	1719.0
figshare	Assessment of GAFF2 and OPLS-AA General Force Fields in Combination with the Water Models TIP3P, SPCE, and OPC3 for the Solvation Free Energy of Druglike Organic Molecules	Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to compute the solvation free energy and the octanol/water partition coefficients for a challenging set of selected organic molecules, characterized by the simultaneous presence of functional groups coarsely spanning a large portion of the chemical space in druglike compounds and, in many cases, by a complex conformational landscape (2-propoxyethanol, acetylsalicylic acid, cyclohexanamine, dialifor, ketoprofen, nitralin, profluralin, terbacil). OPLS-AA and GAFF2 parametrizations of the organic molecules and of 1-octanol have been done via the Web-based automatic parameter generators, LigParGen [Dodda et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 2017, 121, 3864] and PrimaDORAC [Procacci J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2017, 57, 1240], respectively. For the water solvent, three popular three-point site models, TIP3P, SPCE, and OPC3, were tested. Solvation free energies in water and 1-octanol are evaluated using a recently developed nonequilibrium alchemical technology [Procacci et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2014, 10, 2813]. Extensive and accurate simulations, including all possible combinations of organic molecule, solvent, and solvent model, are allowed to assess the accuracy with regard to solvation free energies of the latest release of two widespread force fields, OPLS and GAFF. The collected data are relevant in the evaluation of the predictive power of these classical force fields (and of the related support software for automated parametrization) with regard to binding free energies in a drug-receptor system for industrial applications.	1758.0
figshare	Molecular Insights into the Loading and Dynamics of Doxorubicin on PEGylated Graphene Oxide Nanocarriers	Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to investigate the loading and dynamics of doxorubicin (DOX) anticancer drug on graphene oxide (GO) and poly­(ethylene glycol) (PEG) decorated GO (PEGGO) nanocarriers in an aqueous environment at human body temperature (310 K) and physiological pH level of 7.4. Mechanisms of DOX adsorption on PEGGO as a function of PEG chain length were revealed. Although the total DOX-nanocarrier interaction energy was the same for the DOX/GO (control), DOX/Sh-PEGGO (short PEG chains consisting of 15 repeat units), and DOX/L-PEGGO (long PEG chains consisting of 30 repeat units) within the margin of error, the PEG-DOX interactions increased with an increase in the PEG chain length. At the same time, the PEG-DOX solvent-accessible contact area almost doubled going from the short to long PEG chains. PEGylation of the GO effectively causes an increase in the average water density around the nanocarrier, which can act as a barrier, leading to the DOX migration to the solvated PEG-free part of the GO surface. This effect is more pronounced for shorter PEG chains. The DOX-DOX solvent-accessible contact area is smaller in the DOX/GO system, which means the drug molecules are less aggregated in this system. However, the level of DOX aggregation is slightly higher for the PEGGO systems. The computational results in this work shed light on the fact that increasing the PEG chain length benefits DOX loading on the nanocarrier, revealing an observation that is difficult to acertain through experiments. Moreover, a detailed picture is provided for the DOX adsorption and retention in PEGGO drug delivery systems, which would enable the researchers to improve the drug’s circulation time, as well as its delivery and targeting efficiency.	1887.0
figshare	Investigating the Solvent Effects on Binding Affinity of PAHs–ExBox4+ Complexes: An Alchemical Approach	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are polluting agents, produced naturally or artificially, widely dispersed in the environment and potentially carcinogenic and immunotoxic to humans and animals, mainly for marine life. Recently, a tetracationic box-shaped cyclophane (ExBox4+) was synthesized, fully characterized, and revealed to form host–guest complexes with PAHs in acetonitrile, demonstrating the potential ability for it to act as a PAHs scavenger. This work investigates, through Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, the binding affinity between different PAHs and ExBox4+ in different solvents: chloroform (nonpolar), acetonitrile (polar protic), and water (polar protic). An alchemical method of simultaneous decoupling-recoupling (SDR) was used and implemented in a newly developed Python program called GHOAT, which fully automates the calculation of binding free energies and invokes the AMBER 2020 simulation package. The results showed that the affinity between ExBox4+ and PAHs in water is much larger than in organic media, with free energies between −5 and −20 kcal/mol, being able to act as a PHAs scavenger with great potential for applications in environmental chemistry such as soil washing. The results also reveal a significant correlation with the experimental available ΔG values. The methodology employed presents itself as an important tool for the in silico determination of binding affinities, not only available for charged cyclophanes but also extensible to several other HG supramolecular systems in condensed media, aiding in the rational design of host–guest systems in a significant way.	1732.0
figshare	Developing a Coarse-Grained Model for Bacterial Cell Walls: Evaluating Mechanical Properties and Free Energy Barriers	The bacterial cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria is a complex biological barrier with multiple layers consisting of the inner membrane, periplasm of peptidoglycan, and the outer membrane with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). With rising antimicrobial resistance there is increasing interest in understanding interactions of small molecules with the cell membrane to aid in the development of novel drug molecules. Hence suitable representations of the bacterial membrane are required to carry out meaningful molecular dynamics simulations. Given the complexity of the cell envelope, fully atomistic descriptions of the cell membrane with explicit solvent are computationally prohibitive, allowing limited sampling with small system sizes. However, coarse-grained (CG) models such as MARTINI allow one to study phenomena at physiologically relevant length and time scales. Although MARTINI models for lipids and the LPS are available in literature, a suitable CG model of peptidoglycan is lacking. Using an all-atom model described by Gumbart et al. [PLoS Comput. Biol. 2014, 10, e1003475], we develop a CG model of the peptidoglycan network within the MARTINI framework. The model is parametrized to reproduce the end-to-end distance of glycan strands. The structural properties such as the equilibrium angle between adjacent peptides along the strands, area per disaccharide, and cavity size distributions agree well with the atomistic simulation results. Mechanical properties such as the area compressibility and the bending modulus are accurately reproduced. While developing novel antibiotics it is important to assess barrier properties of the peptidogylcan network. We evaluate and compare the free energy of insertion for a thymol molecule using umbrella sampling on both the MARTINI and all-atom peptidoglycan models. The insertion free energy was found to be less than kBT for both the MARTINI and all-atom models. Additional restraint free simulations reveal rapid translocation of thymol across peptidogylcan. We expect that the proposed MARTINI model for peptidoglycan will be useful in understanding phenomena associated with bacterial cell walls at larger length and time scales, thereby overcoming the current limitations of all-atom models.	2373.0
figshare	LassoHTP: A High-Throughput Computational Tool for Lasso Peptide Structure Construction and Modeling	Lasso peptides are a subclass of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides with a slipknot conformation. With superior thermal stability, protease resistance, and antimicrobial activity, lasso peptides are promising candidates for bioengineering and pharmaceutical applications. To enable high-throughput computational prediction and design of lasso peptides, we developed a software, LassoHTP, for automatic lasso peptide structure construction and modeling. LassoHTP consists of three modules, including the scaffold constructor, mutant generator, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulator. With a user-provided sequence and conformational annotation, LassoHTP can either generate the structure and conformational ensemble as is or conduct random mutagenesis. We used LassoHTP to construct eight known lasso peptide structures de novo and to simulate their conformational ensembles for 100 ns MD simulations. For benchmarking, we calculated the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of these ensembles with reference to their experimental crystal or NMR PDB structures; we also compared these RMSD values against those of the MD ensembles that are initiated from the PDB structures. Dihedral principal component analysis was also conducted. The results show that the LassoHTP-initiated ensembles are similar to those of the PDB-initiated ensembles. LassoHTP offers a computational platform to develop strategies for lasso peptide prediction and design.	1571.0
figshare	Classical Force Fields Tailored for QM Applications: Is It Really a Feasible Strategy?	Classical molecular dynamics is more and more often coupled to quantum mechanical based techniques as a statistical tool to sample configurations of molecular systems embedded in complex environments. Nonetheless, the classical potentials describing the molecular systems are seldom parametrized to reproduce electronic processes, such as electronic excitations, which are instead very sensitive to the underlining description of the molecular structure. Here, we analyze the challenging case of the peridinin molecule, a natural apocarotenoid responsible for the light-harvesting process in the PCP antenna protein of dinoflagellates. Ground-state structural and vibrational properties, as well as electronic transitions of the pigment are studied by means of quantum-mechanical static and dynamic calculations. Thereafter, classical molecular dynamics simulations are performed with a number of different force-fields, ranging from a popular, general purpose one to refined potentials of increasing level of complexity. From the comparison of classical results with their quantum mechanical counterparts, it appears that, while very poor results are obtained from standard transferrable force-fields, specifically tuned potentials are able to correctly characterize most of the structural and vibrational features of the pigment. Nonetheless, only an advanced parametrization technique is able to give a semiquantitative description of the coupling between vibrations and electronic excitations, thus suggesting that the use of classical MD in combination of QM calculations for the study of photoinduced processes, albeit possible, should be considered with care.	1752.0
figshare	Biosynthetic Mechanism of Lanosterol: A Completed Story	The remarkable biochemical conversion of acyclic 2,3-oxidosqualene to tetracyclic lanosterol (the common precursor to cholesterol and its relatives) with seven stereocenters constructed, catalyzed by oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC), has fascinated chemists for over a half century. Although many experimental and theoretical efforts have been reported, most of the studies focused on the initial cyclization while the subsequent cascade carbocation rearrangement and deprotonation were ignored, which determine the regio- and stereochemistry of the final product lanosterol associated with the function-related structure domains of cholesterol and its relatives. Herein we continue our previous works on the cyclization (Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2015, 54, 8693–8696); the mechanistic details of the remaining part of lanosterol biosynthesis, involving three hydride shifts, two methyl shift and one deprotonation, were investigated by quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We obtained the complete free energy profile for lanosterol biosynthesis, which is thermodynamically and kinetically reasonable for the sole formation of the desired product with byproducts effectively avoided. We identified some key factors such as electrostatic interactions and CH···π interactions that facilitate migration of the carbocation. We also identified the direct deprotonation precursor, intermediate I, which has been controversial in previous studies. More importantly, we found that the enzyme mediates the energy transfer from the initial cyclization to the subsequent rearrangements through the electric field of the active pocket, which guarantees the fidelity of the enzyme catalysis.	1774.0
figshare	Small Changes in Hydration Determine Cephalosporinase Activity of OXA-48 β‑Lactamases	β-Lactamase mediated antibiotic resistance threatens treatment of bacterial infections. OXA-48 enzymes are clinically important class D serine β-lactamases (SBLs) that confer resistance to most β-lactam antibiotics, including carbapenems. However, OXA-48 and related enzymes vary widely in their activity toward different substrates: OXA-48 primarily hydrolyzes carbapenems, whereas the OXA-163 variant is a cephalosporinase with minimal carbapenemase activity. The basis of cephalosporinase activity in OXA-163 remains elusive. Here we use QM/MM reaction simulations (umbrella sampling molecular dynamics) to study the breakdown of the cephalosporin antibiotic ceftazidime, a key antibiotic for healthcare-associated infections, by selected OXA-48 variants. Calculated free energy barriers for ceftazidime deacylation correctly capture the differing catalytic efficiencies of the studied enzymes and identify the catalytically competent orientation for bound ceftazidime. Additionally, we show that high flexibility of the Ω loop bordering the active site, a determinant of specificity in many SBLs, is not required for efficient deacylation. Based on our simulations, cephalosporin breakdown in OXA-163 is efficient due to subtle control of active site solvation, which requires a particular orientation of Leu158 in the Ω loop. Our simulations further predict that a single mutation in the OXA-48 β5-β6 loop (Arg214Ser) will increase the efficiency of ceftazidime deacylation to that of OXA-163. The finding that the hydration of the general base in the active site determines deacylation efficiency is possibly important in other class D β-lactamases.	1740.0
figshare	Solvent-Mediated Affinity of Polymer-Wrapped Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes for Chemically Modified Surfaces	Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube (s-CNT) arrays are being explored for next-generation semiconductor electronics. Even with the multitude of alignment and spatially localized s-CNT deposition methods designed to control s-CNT deposition, fundamental understanding of the driving forces for s-CNT deposition is still lacking. The individual roles of the dispersant, solvent, target substrate composition, and the s-CNT itself are not completely understood because it is difficult to decouple deposition parameters. Here, we study poly­[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-alt-co-(6,6′-[2,2′-{bipyridine}])] (PFO-BPy)-wrapped s-CNT deposition from solution onto a chemically modified substrate. We fabricate various self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) to gain a greater understanding of substrate effects on PFO-BPy-wrapped s-CNT deposition. We observe that s-CNT deposition is dependent on both the target substrate and s-CNT dispersion solvent. To complement the experiments, molecular dynamics simulations of PFO-BPy-wrapped s-CNT deposition on two different SAMs are performed to obtain mechanistic insights into the effect of the substrate and solvent on s-CNT deposition. We find that the global free-energy minimum associated with favorable s-CNT adsorption occurs for a configuration in which the minimum of the solvent density around the s-CNT coincides with the minimum of the solvent density above a SAM-grafted surface, indicating that solvent structure near a SAM-grafted surface determines the adsorption free-energy landscape driving s-CNT deposition. Our results will help guide informative substrate design for s-CNT array fabrication in semiconductor devices.	1788.0
figshare	Thermodynamics of N‑Isopropylacrylamide in Water: Insight from Experiments, Simulations, and Kirkwood–Buff Analysis Teamwork	The behavior of thermoresponsive polymer poly­(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPAM), an essential building block in the design of smart soft materials, in aqueous solutions has attracted much interest, which contrasts with our knowledge of N-isopropylacrylamide (NiPAM) monomer. Strikingly, the physicochemical properties of aqueous NiPAM are similarly rich, and their understanding is far from being complete. This stems from the lack of accurate thermodynamic data and quantitative model for atomistic simulations. In this joint study, we have probed the thermodynamic behavior of aqueous NiPAM by experimental methods, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and Kirkwood–Buff (KB) analysis at ambient conditions. From the partial molar volumes and simultaneously correlated osmotic coefficients, with excess partial molar enthalpies of NiPAM in water, the concentration and temperature dependence of KB integrals was determined. For the purpose of this work, we have developed and employed a novel NiPAM force field, which not only reproduces KB integrals (Gij) and adequately captures macroscopic thermodynamic quantities but also provides more accurate structural insight than the original force fields. We revealed in the vicinity of NiPAM the competing effect of amide hydration with interaction between nonpolar regions. This microscopic picture is reflected in the experimentally observed NiPAM–NiPAM association, which is present from highly dilute conditions up to the solubility limit and is evidenced by G22. From intermediate concentrations, it is accompanied by the existence of apparent dense-water regions, as indicated by positive G11 values. The here-employed KB-based framework provided a mutually consistent thermodynamic and microscopic insight into the NiPAM solution and may be further extended for ion-specific effects. Moreover, our findings contribute to the understanding of thermodynamic grounds behind PNiPAM collapse transition.	2076.0
