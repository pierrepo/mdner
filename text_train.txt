Title: Large DPPC monolayer simulations with Charmm36+OPC @ 298 K (Part 2/2)
Description:
DPPC monolayers simulated at a varying area per lipid in the NVT ensemble. The Charmm36 lipid model [1] is employed together with the 4-point OPC water model [2]. Each system contains two monolayers with 256 lipids each. These monolayers are separated by a water slab, and surrounded by vacuum.  The number in the filename corresponds to the area per lipid in Ångströms. The starting structures were generated by setting up a POPC monolayer system with an area per lipid of 50 Å^2, followed by a simulation during which the monolayer area was expanded using PLUMED. Next, POPC was replaced by DPPC, and the systems were energy minimized. Systems with area smaller than 51 Å^2 were generated by compressing the DPPC monolayer system with PLUMED. All trajectories, 100–200 ns long (until convergence of surface tension), are simulated with Gromacs 5.0.x [3] using the default Charmm36 monolayer simulations parameters given in the mdp file. This file, together with the topology (.top) and index files (common for all systems) are available in Part 1 of this upload (see below). The topologies (.itp) for the lipids can be obtained from Charmm-GUI and for the OPC water model from https://bioinformatics.cs.vt.edu/~izadi/ .

Title: Simulation of a POPC bilayer at 298K, lipid model by Maciejewski and Rog
Description:
Simulation of a POPC bilayer containing 128 lipids with 40 water molecules per lipid and in the absence of ions at 298 K. The lipid model by Maciejewski and Rog [1,2] was used. Topologies (.itp) were obtained from [2]. TIP3P water was used, and the ions were modelled using default OPLS ion parameters. The simulation is 200 ns long with trajectory saved every 100 ps. Simulations were performed with Gromacs 2016.3 [3] The trajectory (.xtc), energy file (.edr), checkpoint file (.cpt), run input file (.tpr), index file (.ndx), topology file (.top), final structure (gro), and the simulation parameter file (.mdp) are provided.

Title: Slipids POPE Simulations (versions 1 and 2) 310 K (NOTE: hexagonal membrane)
Description:
Two Slipids POPE bilayer simulations performed using GROMACS 5.0.6 for 200 ns with different starting velocities. Simulations were performed with a 1.0 nm cut-off with PME for the Coulombic and a 1.0 nm cut-off for the van der Waals interactions interactions. These simulations were performed at 310 K with a 336 hexagonal lipid bilayer. The full trajectories are provided bar the initial 100 ns. The starting structure of the membrane was made by reverse mapping an equilibrated MARTINI POPE bilayer (constructed with the INSANE script).

Title: GROMOS-CKP POPE Simulations (versions 1 and 2) 313 K
Description:
Two GROMOS-CKP POPE bilayer simulations performed using GROMACS 5.0.6 for 500 ns with different starting velocities. Simulations were performed with a 1.4 nm cut-off with PME for the Coulombic and a 1.4 nm cut-off for the van der Waals interactions with a dispersion correction. These simulations were performed at 313 K with a 128 lipid bilayer. The full trajectories are provided bar the initial 100 ns. The starting structure was taken from an equilibrated POPE membrane simulated with an older version of the force field which used the PC charges in the head group (see the SI of https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp207013v). The newer PE parameters were constructed using the standard GROMOS lysine parameters.

Title: SIRAH-CoV2 initiative: T307I Mutation in a SARS-CoV-2 Spike from sub-Antarctic Chile
Description:
This dataset contains the trajectories of 10 microseconds-long coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of the soluble part of the wild-type spike protein of SARS-CoV2, the single mutant D614G, and the double mutant T307I/D614G. Simulations are based on the PDB structure 6XR8. Loops were completed using the SwissProt sever, and glycans were not included. Simulations were performed using the SIRAH force field 2.0 running with the Gromacs 2018.3 package at the Institut Pasteur de Montevideo under the conditions reported in Machado et al. JCTC 2019, adding 150 mM NaCl according to Machado & Pantano JCTC 2020.  The following files in gromacs format are provided for each simulation: i) a .psf containing the topological information (connectivity, etc) ii) a big .xtc file containing 10 microseconds of the CG protein recorded every 200 picoseconds (50000 frames) iii) a smaller .xtc file containing the same trajectory but with only one frame per nanosecond (1000 frames) iv) a .gro file with the initial configuration Finally, the file sirah_vmdtk.tcl contains a series of macros and scripts that facilitate the visualization and analysis of the CG trajectories. Step-By-Step tutorials for visualizing and analyzing CG trajectories using SirahTools can be found at www.sirahff.com. To take a quick look at a trajectory using VMD 1.9.3, run the command: > vmd SpikeWT-SIRAH.psf SpikeWT-SIRAH.gro SpikeWT-SIRAH-1kfrm.xtc -e sirah_vmdtk.tcl Note that you can use normal VMD drawing methods as vdw, licorice, etc., and coloring by restype, element, name, etc.  This dataset is part of the SIRAH-CoV2 initiative for data sharing.

Title: Molecular Dynamics Simulation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein
Description:
Trajectory data corresponding to the manuscript, tentatively titled "Distant Residues Modulate the Conformational Opening in SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein" Authors: Dhiman Ray, Ly Le, Ioan Andricioaei Affiliation: University of California Irvine, USA Description: Multiple unbiased simulations of 40 ns were performed for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Frames are saved at 50 ps interval. The initial structures were generated from umbrella sampling simulation starting from PDB ID: 6VSB and 6VXX. The index at the end of filename stands for the umbrella sampling window from which the trajectory was initiated. The indices are not continuous as not all the umbrella sampling windows were used to start trajectories. Additionally 3 trajectories, each of length 80 ns, are included for the closed, partially open and fully open state. The topology is provided as a PDB file ("spike_dry.pdb"). The trajectories are for the spike head only structure obtained from the CHARMM-GUI Covid-19 archive. No solvent or ions are included in the trajectory or the topology. Update: Additional trajectories and PDB files for D614G mutant added. Each trajectory is 40 ns long. The PDB files are named 6VXX_mutant_dry.pdb and 6VSB_mutant_dry.pdb for the closed and partially open state. Pre-print available: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.07.415596

Title: Simulations of DPPC/Cholesterol bilayers with the Slipids force field, part 2/2
Description:
Simulation data related to our publication "Nanoscale Membrane Domain Formation Driven by Cholesterol" (DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-01247-9), part 2/2. Part 1/2 of the data are in the Zenodo record (DOI:10.5281/zenodo.439066). Please note that the description below covers both parts. Data for both cholesterol-free calibration simulations (letters in Table S1 and Fig. 1) and for cholesterol-containing simulations (numbers in Table S1 and Fig. 1) are included. The files are named as "dppc-X-Y.Z", where X is the cholesterol concentration, Y the simulation temperature (not shifted, see the paper), and Z defines the file type (in GROMACS formats): xtc for trajectory, edr for energy file, tpr for the simulation input file, and .cpt for the checkpoint file. The index file (.ndx) and the topology file (.top) are common among systems with equal cholesterol concentration. The simulation parameter file (.mdp) is common for all simulations, only the target temperature of the thermostat needs to be adjusted. Simulation lengths vary between 300 and 1400 ns, and the trajectories are written every 100 ps. Further information on the setup and composition of the simulated systems is available in the paper. The Slipids force field [1,2,3] is employed, and the topologies (.itp) are available at http://www.fos.su.se/~sasha/SLipids/ All simulations were performed with Gromacs 4.6.x    [1] Derivation and Systematic Validation of a Refined All-Atom Force Field for Phosphatidylcholine Lipids.
