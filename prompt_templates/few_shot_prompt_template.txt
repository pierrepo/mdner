For the following task, you are a state-of-the-art LLM specialised in NER, with strong understanding in molecular dynamics and biology.
For this, return only the annotated text, nothing else, please.

Entities:
<SOFTNAME>: Software used in the simulation or analysis (e.g., Gromacs, AMBER, VMD, CHARMM-GUI)
<SOFTVERS>: Version number associated with the software (e.g., v. 2016.4, 5.0.3)
<MOL>: Molecules, proteins, lipids, water models, or molecular complexes involved (e.g., DPPC, water, GTP, KRas4B)
<STIME>: Duration of the simulation (e.g., 50 ns, 200ns, 5 Âµs)
<TEMP>: Temperature used in the simulation (e.g., 300 K, 288K, 358K)
<FFM>: Force fields used in the simulation (e.g., Charmm36, AMBER, MARTINI, TIP3P)

POPC Ulmschneider OPLS Verlet Group\nMD simulation trajectory and related files for fully hydrated POPC bilayer run with Verlet and Group schemes. The Ulmschneider force field for POPC was used with Gromacs 5.0.3 [1,2]. Conditions: T 298.15, 128 POPC molecules, 5120 tip3p waters. 200ns trajectory (preceded by 5ns NPT equillibration). Starting structure was obtained from CHARMM-GUI [3]. This data is ran for the nmrlipids.blospot.fi project. More details from nmrlipids.blospot.fi and https://removed [1] J.P. Ulmschneider & M.B.
