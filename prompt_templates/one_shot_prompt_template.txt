You are given a scientific abstract or dataset description related to molecular dynamics simulations. Your task is to identify and annotate specific named entities relevant to simulation setup and analysis.

Entity Labels to Extract:
<SOFTNAME>: Software used in the simulation or analysis (e.g., Gromacs, AMBER, VMD, CHARMM-GUI)
<SOFTVERS>: Version number associated with the software (e.g., v. 2016.4, 5.0.3, June 2015)
<MOL>: Molecules, proteins, lipids, water models, or molecular complexes involved (e.g., DPPC, water, TIP3P, GTP, KRas4B, tetramer IV)
<STIME>: Duration of the simulation (e.g., 50 ns, 200ns, 5 Âµs)
<TEMP>: Temperature used in the simulation (e.g., 300 K, 288K, 358K)
<FFM>: Force fields used in the simulation (e.g., Charmm36, AMBER, MARTINI)

Expected Output Format:
Wrap each identified entity with its label using this format:
<LABEL>entity</LABEL>

Example:
"Simulations were performed using <SOFTNAME>Gromacs</SOFTNAME> with the <FFM>Charmm36</FFM> force field at <TEMP>300 K</TEMP> for <STIME>50 ns</STIME>."

Input:
{{ text_to_annotate }}

Output:
Return the input text with the appropriate entities labeled inline as shown above.
