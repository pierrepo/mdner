Interaction of the inhibitory peptides ShK and HmK with the voltage-gated potassium channel KV1.3: Role of conformational dynamics\nABSTRACT: Peptide toxins that adopt the ShK fold can inhibit the voltage-gated potassium channel KV1.3 with IC50 values in the pM range, and are therefore potential leads for drugs targeting autoimmune and neuroinflammatory diseases. NMR relaxation measurements and pressure-dependent NMR have shown that, despite being cross-linked by disulfide bonds, ShK itself is flexible in solution. This flexibility affects the local structure around the pharmacophore for KV1.3 channel blockade and, in particular, the relative orientation of the key Lys and Tyr side chains (Lys22 and Tyr23 in ShK), and has implications for the design of KV1.3 inhibitors. In this study, we have performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on ShK and a close homolog, HmK, in order to probe the conformational space occupied by the Lys and Tyr residues, and docked the different conformations with a recently determined cryo-EM structure of the KV1.3 channel. Although ShK and HmK have 60% sequence identity, their dynamic behaviors are quite different, with ShK sampling a broad range of conformations over the course of a 5 μs MD simulation, while HmK is relatively rigid. We also investigated the importance of conformational dynamics, in particular the distance between the side chains of the key dyad Lys22 and Tyr23, for binding to KV1.3. Although these peptides have quite different dynamics, the dyad in both adopts a similar configuration upon binding, revealing a conformational selection upon binding to KV1.3 in the case of ShK . Intriguingly, the more flexible peptide, ShK , binds with nearly 300-fold higher affinity than HmK .

Automated protein-protein structure prediction of the T cell receptor-peptide major histocompatibility complex\nThe T Cell Receptor (TCR) recognition of a peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) is a crucial component of the adaptive immune response. The identification of TCR-pMHC pairs is a significant bottleneck in the implementation of TCR immunotherapies and may be augmented by computational methodologies that accelerate the rate of TCR discovery. The ability to computationally design TCRs to a target pMHC will require an automated integration of next-generation sequencing, homology modeling, molecular dynamics (MD), and TCR ranking. We present a generic pipeline to evaluate patient-specific, sequence-based TCRs to a target pMHC. The most expressed TCRs from 16 colorectal cancer patients are homology modeled to target the CEA peptide using Modeller and ColabFold. Then, these TCR-pMHC structures are compared by performing an automated molecular dynamics equilibration. We find that Colabfold generates starting configurations that require, on average, an ~2.5X reduction in simulation time to equilibrate TCR-pMHC structures compared to Modeller. In addition, there are differences between equilibrated structures generated by Modeller and ColabFold. Moreover, we identify TCR ranking criteria that may be used to prioritize TCRs for evaluation of in vitro immunogenicity.

Molecular dynamics simulation of tricaproin in gas phase using machine-learning potential ANI2x\nTricaproin (Glycerol trihexanoate) is an example of a triglyceride molecule with very short alkyl tails attached to the glycerol moiety, and this deposit contains a 10 ns long simulation of tricaproin in a gas phase. The model chemistry (a.k.a. interaction potential or force field) is the machine-learning potential ANI2x implemented in python package torchANI, which has a close-to-DFT accuracy, yet low cost compared to DFT or other electronic structure theories. Molecular dynamics were run using ASE with Langevin integrator at a constant temperature of 310 K. The resulting trajectory was written every 1 ps ("traj.h5", can be viewed in ASEgui), and gathered every 10 ps in a XTC format ("traj.xtc", open in MDAnalysis, VMD, UnityMol, GROMACS tools ...). Detailed simulation settings are in the python script. This simulation was performed for the purpose of building a coarse grained Martini 3 model of this molecule.

Understanding the Mannose Transfer Mechanism of Mycobacterial Phosphatidyl-myo-inositol Mannosyltransferase A from Molecular Dynamics Simulations\nGlycolipids like phosphatidylinositol hexamannosides (PIM6) and lipoglycans, such as lipomannan (LM) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM), play crucial roles in virulence, survival, and antibiotic resistance of various mycobacterial species. Phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosyltransferase A (PimA) catalyzes the transfer of the mannose moiety (M) from GDP-mannose (GDPM) to phosphatidyl-myo-inositol (PI) to synthesize GDP and phosphatidyl-myo-inositol monomannoside (PIM). This PIM is mannosylated, acylated, and further modified to give rise to the higher PIMs, LM, and LAM. It is yet to be known how PI, PIM, PI-GDPM, and PIM-GDP interact with PimA. Here, we report the docked structures of PI and PIM to understand how the substrates and the products interact with PimA. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for 300 ns, we have investigated how various ligand-bound conformations change the dynamics of PimA. Our studies demonstrated the open to closed motions of PimA. We observed that PimA is least dynamic when bound to both GDPM and PI. MD simulations indicated that the loop residues 59 70 and the -helical residues 73 86 of PimA play important roles while interacting with both PI and PIM. MD analyses also suggested that the residues Y9, P59, R68, L69, N97, R196, R201, K202, and R228 of PimA play significant roles in the mannose transfer reaction. Overall, docking studies and MD simulations provide crucial insights to design future therapeutic drugs against mycobacterial PimA.

Melting Points of OPC and OPC3 Water Models\nA recently introduced family of globally optimal water models, OPC, has shown promise in a variety of biomolecular simulations, but properties of these water models outside of the liquid phase remain mostly unexplored. Here, we contribute to filling the gap by reporting melting temperatures of ice Ih of OPC and OPC3 water models. Through the direct coexistence method, which we make available in the AMBER package, the melting points of OPC and OPC3 are estimated as 242 and 210 K, similar to TIP4P-Ew and SPC/E models, respectively, and appreciably below the experimental value of 273.15 K under 1 bar pressure. Water models of the OPC family were optimized to best reproduce water properties in the liquid phase where these models offer noteworthy accuracy advantages over many models of previous generations. It is not surprising that the accuracy of OPC models in describing the phase transition to the solid state does not appear to offer similar improvements. The new anisotropic barostat option implemented in AMBER may benefit system preparation and simulation outside of the direct coexistence applications, such as modeling of membranes or very long DNA strands.

Thriving in the heat Lysine acetylation stabilizes the quaternary structure of a Mega-Dalton hyperthermoactive PEP-synthase\nOver time structural adaptations enabled proteins and enzymes to have sufficient stability and flexibility to perform the basic functions of life under various environmental conditions. The catalytic cores of key metabolic enzymes of hyperthermophilic archaea work at a temperature range of 80-120 C, similar to the conditions wher the earliest life forms may have thrived. Here we characterize a key enzyme of the central carbon metabolism of Pyrococcus furious, through an integrative approach combining structural mass spectrometry, cryo-electron microscopy, mass photometry and molecular modelling with molecular dynamics simulations. From our investigation, we unveil the structural organization of phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (PPSA). Its 24-meric assembly - weighing over 2 MDa - harbors flexible distal domains, whose proper functioning and coordination depends on widespread chemical acetylation of lysine residues. This non-enzymatic post-translational modification, along with other types of lysine modifications, also occurs on most other major protein complexes of P. furiosus. These modifications likely originated in the chemically favorable primordial conditions and gradually became highly specialized and enzyme-driven in more distantly related mesophiles and Eukaryotes. Molecular dynamics simulations and analysis The all-atom structures of the full c1 (X4) 24-mer PPSA models, carrying highly acetylated sites at 14 positions (106, 120,185, 187, 427, 466, 492, 496, 557, 574, 641, 726, 737, 805) or unmodified lysines were coarse grained (CG), mapping their atoms to the SIRAH force field (ff), that uses a classical Hamiltonian common to most all-atom potentials to describe particle particle interactions, and recently extended to support the PTMs most commonly found on proteins (Garay et al., 2020). Both starting structures contained a disulfide bond between Cys42-Cys189 as well as phosphorylation of Thr440. All starting structures, simulation boxes and parameters files used for the minimization, equilibration and production are provided (Supplementary Data 5). Simulation was conducted in GROMACS 2020.4 (Hess et al., 2008), for which code can be found here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5636522. The 24-aly system consisted of 94128 CG atoms for the protein representation, solvated with 179271 WT4 CG water beads (Garay et al., 2020). A neutral charge was achieved adding 6617 NaW (Na+) and 5633 ClW (Cl-), corresponding to a concentration of approximately 150 mM NaCl concentration. The 24-lys system was also prepared accordingly and consisted of 93456 CG atoms for the protein, 186690 WT4 CG water beads and neutralized with 6503 NaW (Na+) and 5855 ClW (Cl-). Solvation was done using the default radii of 0.105 nm for atoms not present in the VdW database (vdwradii.dat) and then removing the WT4 molecules within 0.3 nm from the solute. In all cases, eventual clashes were relaxed during the solute-restrained energy minimization. Due to the length of the loops connecting the 3 domains, an alternative configuration of the tetramers where the CD-NBD domains are sitting on top of the neighboring PPSA subunit is also possible (see Supplementary Note 1). This was named alternative (a) configuration, as opposed to the original (o), thus producing 4 starting models: a24-aly, o24-aly, a24-lys and o24-lys (Supplementary Data 5). All these configurations were subjected to a first round of production consisting of 125 ns in duplicate to define the stable configuration for further extension of the simulation time to 500 ns. The main stages of the simulation can be summarized as follows:1) solvent and side-chain relaxation by 2 stages of 20 000 steps of energy minimization, imposing positional restraints of 1000 kJ mol-1 nm-2 on the whole protein (stage 1) and only on backbone beads (GN and GO, stage 2); 2) solvent NVT ensemble equilibration with a first stage where the temperature was slowly increased from 303K to 363K in 7 steps of 4 ns each, and a second stage to equilibrate the protein by gradually releasing the positional restraints from 1000 kJ mol-1 nm-2 on the backbone beads (GN and GO) to 100 kJ mol-1 nm-2 on the C-terminus to compensate for the missing stabilization effect of the Met799-Fe cluster; 3) production simulation of an additional 80 ns in NPT ensemble at 363 K and 1 bar imposing positional restraints of 100 kJ mol-1 nm-2 on the C-terminus. Non-bonded interactions were treated with a 1.2 nm cutoff and PME for long-range electrostatics. An integration time-step of 15 fs was used during MD production runs. The system pressure was controlled by the Parrinello-Rahman barostat (Parrinello and Rahman, 1981) with a coupling time of 4 ps. The positional restraints during the production simulation were necessary to maintain the overall system at the high energy of the particles at 363 K (90 C), the temperature mimicking the near-optimum temperature for PPSA catalytic activity. All simulations were run in duplicate. Although the simulations do not accurately reflect the possible dynamics of the protein in native conditions, the computational challenges of simulating >350000 atoms for the protein only drove us to use a CG representation of the system. To analyze the trajectories, every functional module (tetramer) was extracted from the simulation of the full 24-mer for each replicate, resulting in two sets of 12 independent trajectories (6 for each 24-mer) either with and without acetylated Lysine residues. To produce morphed movies and analyze secondary structure and interfaces, the CG tetramers trajectories were back mapped to atomistic detail using SIRAH tools via VMD. A back mapped atomistic model was produced every 35.7 ns, and subjected to 100 cycles of energy minimization in AMBER, resulting in 14 atomistic models describing each trajectory of a given tetramer over the 500 ns of simulation, further interpolated in ChimeraX using the morph command to produce the atomistic representation of the dynamics (Supplementary Data 5). RMSD calculation and trajectory analysis were done with the MDanalysis suite (Michaud-Agrawal et al., 2011). Each probability density in Figure 5B and 5C is calculated over two independent coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of the last 250 ns of production of the PPSA 24-mer in the acetylated and non-acetylated form, using a snapshot frequency of 5 ns. In Figure 5B, the RMSD of the C atoms (equivalent to backbone GC beads in CG MD) of the NBD region (residues 1-365) in the tetramer form was calculated with respect to their conformation in the tetramer PPSA resting state. The six trajectories of all six tetramers included in the simulated PPSA complex, resulting in 3 μs ([250ns*6]*2) of accumulated tetramer simulation, were used in the probability density calculation. In Figure 5C, the RMSD of the C atoms (equivalent to backbone GC beads in CG MD) was calculated over the CD (residues 379-481) and PBD (residues 510-790) regions with respect to the modelled CD-PBD state of PPSA in the monomer form. All 24 PPSA monomers of which the simulated PPSA complex was composed were included in the probability density calculation, resulting in 12 μs ([250ns*24]*2) of accumulated PPSA monomer simulation.
