Title: Simulations of POPC lipid bilayer in water solution with various molar fractions of cationic surfactant dihexadecylammonium using ECC-POPC force field
Description:
Classical molecular dynamics simulations of a POPC lipid bilayer in water solution with various molar fractions of cationic surfactant dihexadecylammonium using ECC-POPC force field parameters, SPC/E water model and ECC-ions. Simulation at pure water is in a separate Zenodo deposit https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1118266 file names report molar fraction of cations (i.e. not bulk concentrations) simulations performed with Gromacs 5.1.4 (.xtc files) and openMM 7 (.dcd files) simulation length 200 ns temperature 313 K (otherwise noted)

Title: CHARMM36 POPC/POPE (50%-50%) MD simulation (300 K - 300ns - 1 bar)
Description:
CHARMM36 POPC 50% POPE 50% bilayer simulation (300 K, starting structure from CHARMM-GUI with 128 POPC and 128 POPE lipids (64 per leaflet for each species) fully hydrated with 34 water molecules per lipid). The trajectory contains the whole simulation from 0 to 300 ns skipped every 100 ps and centered on the P atoms. No ions were added as there is no charge in the system. This bilayer was used to calculate the order parameter and the area per lipid for the NMRlipids project (on the time window 50-300 ns).

Title: POPC with varying amounts of cholesterol, 130 mM of NaCl. Slipids with ions by Smith & Dang
Description:
Simulations of a POPC bilayer with varying amounts (0, 10, 20, and 30 mol-%) of cholesterol and 130 mM of NaCl performed at 310 K. The POPC bilayer consists of 200 lipids (100 per leaflet) and on top of that there is 0 (0%), 22 (10%), 50 (20%), or 86 (30%) of cholesterol. Additionally, simulations with 0% cholesterol are repeated at 330 K, 350 K, and 370 K. The Slipids model [1–3] is employed for lipids, tip3p model for water, and the ion parameters by Smith and Dang [4] for NaCl. The Slipids force field parameters are available at http://www.fos.su.se/~sasha/SLipids/ and the ion parameters are available at https://bitbucket.org/hseara/ions/ –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– The files are in GROMACS format and named based on the amount of cholesterol present (in %) in the corresponding simulation. Trajectories (.xtc) are 200 ns long with data saved every 100 ps. Additionally, the final structure (.gro), topology (.top), index file (.ndx), energy output file (.edr), and binary run input files (for Gromacs 4.6->) (.tpr) are provided for each system.
